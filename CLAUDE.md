# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PlayAural is an audio-first multiplayer online gaming platform with four first-party components:
- **`server/`** — Python async WebSocket server with game logic, auth, tables, persistence, localization, and ratings
- **`client/`** — Python wxPython desktop client with screen reader-oriented keyboard UX
- **`web_client/`** — Modular vanilla JS PWA with ARIA live output, desktop-style keyboard navigation, touch menus, browser audio/Web Speech, capped history buffers, and table voice chat
- **`mobile_client/`** — Expo / React Native / TypeScript mobile client with self-voicing gesture navigation

PlayAural also supports table-scoped real-time voice chat. The game server authorizes access and tracks voice membership, while a separate LiveKit-based media service carries the actual audio stream.

The project is open source under the **GNU General Public License, version 3 or
any later version**. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Commands

### Server
```bash
# Run server (default port 8000)
cd server && python -m server
python -m server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000 --ssl-cert cert.pem --ssl-key key.pem

# Run tests. pytest and the asyncio/xdist plugins live in the server project's
# `dev` extra, so go through uv with `--extra dev` — bare `python` is the global
# interpreter and has none of the project deps. `--project server` selects the
# server venv; the command runs in the current directory, so invoke it from the
# repo root.
uv run --project server --extra dev python -m pytest server/tests -q
# Single test / file
uv run --project server --extra dev python -m pytest server/tests/test_file.py::test_function
```

During iteration, run only the tests covering the files you touched and their
dependents. The suite is ~1650 tests and takes about 25 seconds serially (add
`-n auto` for the `pytest-xdist` parallel path) on a modern machine; running it
whole as an inner-loop step is still a waste. Run the full suite before
committing anything that crosses subsystems, and before landing a feature — not
after every edit.

The suite no longer depends on the working directory — every test now pins the
Fluent locales dir `__file__`-relative — but run from the repo root anyway so
the `uv run --project server` command resolves naturally.

The suite is parallel-safe under `pytest-xdist` (in the `dev` extra; `-n auto`
or `-n 6`). An autouse `_isolate_localization` fixture in
`server/tests/conftest.py` snapshots and restores the class-level `Localization`
state around every test, so a test that repoints or wipes the global Fluent
bundle cache (e.g. the MOTD fixture) can no longer leak to siblings on the same
worker. Keep new tests RNG-deterministic — disable random-outcome options
(e.g. pusoydos `instant_wins=False`) when asserting on exact game state, since
parallel runs surface latent RNG flakiness fast.

### Desktop Client
```bash
python client/client.py
```

### Web Client
Serve `web_client/` from any HTTP server. For local development:
```bash
python -m http.server 8080 --directory web_client
node web_client/scripts/generate-sound-manifest.mjs
npm --prefix web_client run test:history
```

### Mobile Client
```bash
cd mobile_client
cmd /c npm install
cmd /c npm run generate:sounds
cmd /c npm run generate:locales
cmd /c npm run typecheck
npx expo start
```

### Production Build (Windows Desktop Client)
```bat
build_prod.bat
```

## Architecture

### Network Protocol
All communication is WebSocket JSON packets:
```python
Packet(type: str, data: dict)  # PacketType enum defines the protocol
```

Important server-driven packets include:
- `authorize_success`
- `login_failed`
- `menu`
- `update_menu`
- `request_input`
- `remove_editbox`
- `speak`
- `audio`
- `chat`
- `disconnect`
- `table_context`
- `voice_join_info`
- `voice_join_error`
- `voice_leave_ack`
- `voice_context_closed`

Authenticated clients use the payload-free `logout` packet for an intentional
application exit. The server, not the client, leaves every registered runtime
activity before retiring the session and returning `force_exit`; this keeps
table, voice, and future room teardown authoritative and ordered.

Clients request the focused row's available help with `menu_description`,
carrying the current `menu_id` and stable `menu_item_id`. The server validates
both against the visible menu before speaking. This is a semantic UI request,
not a gameplay keybind.

**`silent` flag on `chat` packets**: Adding `"silent": True` suppresses both chat notification sounds and TTS in the first-party clients. Use it only when the server is also sending explicit `speak` and/or `audio` packets to control the output precisely.

### Social Blocking Boundary

User blocks are directional persistent records retained until explicit
unblocking or either account is deleted. A block in either direction creates a
mutual direct-contact boundary: neither account may send the other friend
requests, private messages, or table invites; ordinary local/global text chat
and presence notifications are filtered in both directions. Applying a block
atomically removes any accepted friendship, pending requests in either
direction, and queued relationship notifications between the pair. Unblocking
does not recreate any of that deleted state. A blocked pair cannot newly enter
tables hosted by one another or be brought together by manually restoring a
saved table. Shared membership, reserved-seat recovery, planned-reboot
restoration, later host transfer, and table voice chat remain unchanged; the
confirmation UI must explain this distinction. Suppress optional global
notifications attributable to blocked accounts, such as table creation.
Enforce the boundary in database and shared server handlers; hidden buttons
alone are never a security or privacy control. Manual saved-table restoration
is an owner-scoped, all-or-nothing new admission: validate the complete
serialized game and member roster before exposing a table, retain the save on
every failure, treat bot-held human seats as their original human accounts,
and identify only the restorer's own blocks when giving unblock instructions.

### Account Identity Boundary

Account identity has three distinct roles. The database UUID is the immutable,
globally unique account id and owns sessions, relationships, moderation targets,
statistics, and every other durable relation. The username is an immutable,
unique login/routing handle; it is currently also the public label, but must
never be rewritten as a display-name change. A future `display_name` is mutable,
non-unique presentation data only: resolve it through the UUID/username owner,
never authenticate, authorize, route, join, or persist a relation by it. Stored
chat, report, and result names are deliberate historical snapshots paired with
immutable ids, not live identity keys. Server-owned identity names are reserved
through the shared registry and cannot be registered by users. When display
names are introduced, identity-sensitive profiles, reports, moderation views,
and confirmations must expose the owning username, while every action id and
payload remains bound to the UUID.

Bot identity is likewise structural, never name-derived. `Player.id` and
`Player.is_bot` are authoritative; `bot_name_base` is serialized presentation
data used to preserve a bot's personality across save/load. Localized base
names may match usernames or other bot bases. Every production bot must expose
a collision-free table label: use the bare base while it is unique, add the
localized bot marker only while a human or another bot shares that base, and
add a stable ordinal when multiple bots share it. A replacement bot retains the
disconnected human's account UUID and reclaim metadata. Reconcile labels across
joins, leaves, replacements, reconnects, and save/load. Never reserve localized
bot bases from registration, infer bot status from text, or route an action by
an unqualified base name.

### Audio Control Protocol

Server-controlled SFX, music, and ambience use the single versioned `audio`
packet. Do not add per-feature packet types or client-specific audio branches.
The server validates relative asset paths, ids, numeric ranges, commands,
kinds, and scopes through `server/audio.py`; clients validate again before
loading an asset.

- Sound-pack version increments are maintainer-controlled release actions.
  Never bump a sound-pack version merely because audio assets or generated
  manifests changed. Change version markers only when the project maintainer
  explicitly requests a bump; otherwise preserve them when adding, replacing,
  converting, normalizing, or regenerating audio assets.
- Optional 3D positions use listener-relative `(x, y, z)` coordinates with the
  listener at the origin facing `+Y`. The server is the positioning authority
  and derives ordinary pan from the same point for non-HRTF fallbacks. Desktop,
  Web, and native mobile playback consume the same spatial contract. Use a
  fixed position for a point event, atomic `segments` for a finite multi-stage
  sound, and stable-handle `update` commands for a replayable moving source.
- Commands are `play`, `update`, `stop`, `pause`, `resume`, `set_bus`, and
  `stop_all`.
- Kinds are `sfx`, `music`, and `ambience`. A named bus may be added without
  changing the protocol and inherits its kind's user-volume preference.
- Randomized numbered one-shot SFX use the validated `family` field. Desktop
  discovers family members from the installed pack, while Web and Mobile use
  generated sound manifests. A family named `notify` resolves dynamically to
  positive-integer assets such as `notify1.ogg`; never hardcode the count, and
  never use a family for loops, music, or ambience.
- Finite multi-stage SFX use one atomic `play` command with complete `segments`
  and a stable handle. Clients validate and preload every asset before starting,
  then schedule each onset from decoded frame counts, pitch, and the validated
  per-segment next-onset ratio on a shared audio clock. A ratio of `1` is
  contiguous; a smaller ratio overlaps authored tails without altering pitch,
  and authored silence remains part of the asset. Segment motion spans that
  segment's decoded duration. Renderers keep every overlapping HRTF tail
  connected until it has finished rather than clipping it at the last decoded
  frame. Never approximate these chains with
  separate packets, server ticks, or replacement-sensitive duration constants.
  Any load or scheduling failure cancels the whole chain, and finite sequences
  remain runtime-only rather than entering `active_audio` replay state.
- Positioned `play` commands may carry a complete `attenuation` object using
  `none`, `linear`, `inverse`, or `exponential`. Active curves always include
  reference/maximum distance, rolloff, and minimum/maximum gain; clients must
  reject partial or out-of-range objects. Omission and explicit `none` both
  spatialize without volume falloff. Evaluate the versioned formulas in the
  shared mixer exactly once and keep renderer/backend distance gain neutral.
- Replayable positioned sources move through a stable-handle `update` command
  carrying complete origin/destination positions, integer duration/elapsed
  milliseconds, and a named easing curve. The server advances and persists
  authoritative trajectory state; clients interpolate on their audio clocks.
  Reconnect resumes from persisted elapsed state, while stop and replacement
  generations cancel stale interpolation. Never persist process clock values.
- A `play` command may set an independent normalized source `gain`. The same
  stable-handle `update` command may carry a complete gain automation, alone or
  concurrently with position motion. Authored volume, source gain, distance
  attenuation, fades, named buses, ducking, and user master volume remain
  separate multiplicative stages; do not fold one into another or evaluate it
  twice. The server persists current gain and unfinished automation so reconnect
  resumes without restarting the asset.
- Stable handles own lifecycle. Looping SFX must keep the returned/provided
  handle and stop it explicitly. Handles are client-global: reusing one for a
  different replayable source replaces the prior ownership in persisted state
  as well as on the client. A private play/update must not partially replace a
  public handle or layer because that cannot be replayed unambiguously.
  Stop/pause/resume are idempotent.
- Music and ambience replacement use simultaneous fade-out/fade-in. Pausing
  music preserves position. Abrupt music stops are reserved for strict
  lifecycle boundaries where audio must not survive into the next context.
- Ambience is keyed by `scope + context + layer`: `global`, `player`, or
  `context` scopes may coexist, and changing one layer must not stop another.
  Environmental boundaries keep neighboring layers alive and phase coherent;
  normalized weights drive linear or equal-power source-gain automation rather
  than stop/play replacement. A zero-gain layer remains owned until an explicit
  lifecycle stop, allowing a later boundary transition without an intro replay.
- Ambience assets may be a simple loop or a segmented stem with optional intro
  and outro. When `seamless` is enabled, intro-to-loop and loop-to-outro are
  contiguous same-stem boundaries: never fade or crossfade those transitions.
  External fades still apply to starting, replacing, pausing, or force-stopping
  independent sources. Normal stop uses an immediate no-fade splice from the
  active loop into its outro, matching legacy teardown behavior and preventing
  a long loop from surviving into another UI context. `outro_mode="boundary"`
  is an explicit opt-in for content whose caller can wait until the current
  loop iteration reaches its authored seam. Waiting lobbies never own
  background music, whether initially created or entered after completion or a
  manual reset. Game completion and reset use `stop_replayable_audio` to retire
  music, ambience, and persistent looping SFX without interrupting untracked
  one-shot result cues; ambience may finish through its authored outro.
  Table-to-main-menu teardown uses `stop_all` with `play_outros=True`, while
  hard resets/transfers may suppress outros to avoid overlap with the next table
  context. Reconnect replay starts at the loop and does not replay an intro that
  the table already heard.
- `priority` and `max_instances` bound SFX pressure. `ducking` temporarily
  lowers named buses for the life of its source and restores them on every
  completion/stop/error path. User volume remains the master gain.
- Cross-client attenuation and automation math uses
  `audio_protocol_v3_conformance.json` at the repository root. Extend that
  single corpus when formulas or easing curves change; never maintain copied
  expected values independently in the four client/server suites.
- One-shot notification SFX may declare the message `buffer` they accompany.
  Clients apply effective buffer mute state before playback. Buffer association
  is invalid for managed or looping audio so lifecycle commands can never be
  suppressed accidentally.
- Ducking is implemented but dormant and strictly opt-in. First-party gameplay
  must not send non-empty `ducking` maps until a future feature explicitly
  adopts and tunes it. Empty/default ducking must have no audible side effects.
- Positioned native mobile playback uses the local Cosmos/miniaudio Expo module
  and the complete official Steam Audio 4.8.1 artifact set. Keep Windows,
  Android, iOS, headers, upstream licenses/notices, and the SHA-256 manifest as
  one reviewed update. Mobile `postinstall` must fail closed on version, hash,
  ABI, or Android 16 KiB alignment drift. The real-time fixed-frame adapter must
  preserve partial input and the HRTF tail across arbitrary device callback
  sizes. Async source creation reserves capacity and collision-free native IDs;
  every failure, replacement, completion, and shutdown path releases them.
  Physical iOS devices use the pinned archive; the simulator must report native
  HRTF unavailable and use the platform fallback.
- Android playback must preserve the system-selected wired, Bluetooth, or
  speaker route; game-audio setup must never force speakerphone routing. ExpoAV
  is the single audio-focus coordinator. The modern `expo-audio` playlist path
  mixes without requesting a competing focus lease, and its guarded native
  routing patch is applied by the mobile `postinstall` script. Keep the patch
  and its fail-closed regression test until upstream provides the same behavior.
  Android autolinking must build `expo-audio` from that guarded local source;
  the default precompiled artifact does not contain the fix.
- Mobile LiveKit voice is media audio, not a phone-call audio session. Android
  must pin `MODE_NORMAL`, `STREAM_MUSIC`, and `USAGE_MEDIA`, leave device
  selection to the system, disable forced AudioSwitch routing, and avoid a
  second LiveKit focus lease even while the microphone is published. iOS must
  disable LiveKit's automatic getUserMedia category override: listen-only uses
  `playback` with `default` mode, and explicit microphone publishing uses the
  required `playAndRecord` category with `default` mode—never `voiceChat` or
  `videoChat`. Preserve stereo Bluetooth A2DP output and exclude the HFP
  hands-free route, which takes priority and collapses output to mono. Keep the
  guarded LiveKit native iOS patch, postinstall hook, and fail-closed dependency
  regression tests.
- Async clients must generation-guard asset loads and fades so a late load or
  retiring source cannot resurrect, silence, or replace a newer command.
- Replayable music, ambience, and explicitly persistent SFX loops live in the
  game's Mashumaro-safe `active_audio` state, including recipient ids and
  paused state. One-shots and client mixer state are runtime-only. Old
  `current_music`/`current_ambience` fields are read-migration bridges for
  pre-protocol saves and must not become a second playback authority.
- `active_audio` has the same lifespan and retention as its containing
  table/game save. Explicit stop, phase reset, table transfer, and game
  replacement remove stale entries; deleting the containing save/table or
  account-owned data deletes it as part of that existing lifecycle. Schema
  migration reads the legacy current-track fields only when unified state is
  absent.
- Gameplay WebSockets carry control JSON only. Voice media remains on LiveKit.

### Server Architecture
- **`server/core/server.py`** — Main orchestrator, auth routing, menus, reconnect, moderation, MOTD, presence
- **`server/network/websocket_server.py`** — Async WebSocket transport
- **`server/games/`** — 51 registered game implementations
- **`server/game_utils/`** — shared game mixins and helpers
- **`server/tables/`** — table lifecycle, save/restore, membership
- **`server/auth/`** — authentication, CAPTCHA checks, password reset, rate limiting
- **`server/persistence/database.py`** — SQLite storage for users, leaderboards, ratings, friends, MOTD, and related state
- **`server/messages/`** — runtime localization engine
- **`server/locales/`** — Fluent locale files
- **`server/voice/`** — voice authorization, token generation, and provider integration

### Voice Chat Architecture
- Voice chat is scoped to a server-defined context, currently game tables.
- The PlayAural game server remains the authority for whether a user may join a voice context.
- The media path is separate from gameplay networking. Gameplay continues over the normal WebSocket connection; live audio flows through the dedicated LiveKit service.
- The server issues short-lived join packets, binds voice access to the caller's current table context, and closes that voice context when table membership ends.
- Server-owned automation reuses `voice_join_info` with
  `server_requested=true`. First-party clients may connect automatically but
  always enter listen-only; microphone publishing remains a separate explicit
  user action. `voice_context_closed` cancels both pending and active joins.
- A live device handover preserves confirmed table-voice listening intent by
  invalidating the old session's grant and issuing the replacement client a
  fresh context-bound server request after its restored `table_context`.
  Reconfirmation is silent to other table members, and an unexpired grant
  explicitly marked as a continuation may carry through another rapid device
  handover. Ordinary pending/manual grants may not. Microphone state and audio
  input selection are device-local and never transfer; the replacement always
  starts listen-only. Preserve the prior confirmed presence only for the
  bounded continuation grant: successful reconfirmation is silent, while an
  explicit client rejection, media connection failure, or grant expiry clears
  it and broadcasts exactly one actual disconnect. Clients revoke grants when
  media setup fails, and the server rejects late presence confirmations after
  authorization expiry.
- Table voice controls are keyed only by immutable account UUID. Host
  microphone moderation is authoritative table policy backed by LiveKit
  participant publish permission; client-side microphone locks are defense in
  depth. Personal mute and volume are private per-listener mixer settings.
  Both are checkpoint-only properties of the durable table: preserve them
  across a game switch and server restore, retain controls *about* a departed
  target for an eventual same-account rejoin, clear preferences owned by a
  listener when that listener leaves, and clear all controls when the table is
  destroyed. Manual saved games must omit them. Never key these controls by a
  username, display name, participant label, or gameplay seat.
- `clear_ui` is an interface-only command: it clears server-owned menus,
  editboxes, and focus state without changing table, game-audio, or voice
  ownership. Lifecycle exits must use `table_context`, unified `audio`
  teardown, and `voice_context_closed`/membership teardown as appropriate.
- Voice presence is runtime-only state. It is tied to the active table lifecycle and must not create long-lived database rows unless a future feature defines retention and cleanup rules explicitly.

### Game Implementation Pattern
Games use a mixin-based architecture. Each game class inherits from `Game`, which brings the standard shared mixins plus `SequenceRunnerMixin`.

Key built-in mixins include:
- `GameSoundMixin`
- `GameCommunicationMixin`
- `GameResultMixin`
- `GameScoresMixin`
- `TurnManagementMixin`
- `MenuManagementMixin`
- `ActionVisibilityMixin`
- `LobbyActionsMixin`
- `EventHandlingMixin`
- `ActionSetCreationMixin`
- `ActionExecutionMixin`
- `OptionsHandlerMixin`
- `ActionSetSystemMixin`

Games are dataclasses serialized via Mashumaro for save/restore. All important game state must live in dataclass fields.

The canonical shared player and action-context types live in `server/game_utils/player.py` and `server/game_utils/action_context.py`. Game modules can use the re-exports from `server/games/base.py`, but they must not create duplicate base `Player` or ad-hoc action context classes.

#### SequenceRunnerMixin for Cinematic Gameplay Flows
`Game` includes `SequenceRunnerMixin`. It is the standard way to build delayed, multi-step gameplay/audio flows that must survive save/load and avoid deadlocks.

Use it for:
- movement animations across ticks
- delayed reveals, captures, eliminations, and roulette-style sequences
- cinematic audio flows
- any legacy `event_queue`-style sequence that is really a timed beat/callback flow

Core primitives:
- `SequenceOperation.sound_op(path, ...)`
- `SequenceOperation.localized_sound_op({"en": "...", "vi": "..."}, ...)`
- `SequenceOperation.callback_op("callback_id", payload={...})`
- `SequenceBeat(ops=[...], delay_after_ticks=N)`
- `SequenceBeat.pause(N)`
- `SequenceBeat.after_audio(duration_ticks, wait_ratio=..., ops=[...])` for
  dynamic delays before the following beat that remain correct when an asset
  is replaced; add a following beat when the sequence must remain active

Standard rule:
- use `SEQUENCE_LOCK_GAMEPLAY` by default
- keep info/status actions available unless a full lock is truly necessary
- call `self.process_sequences()` in `on_tick()`
- if bots should wait, pass `pause_bots=True` and gate bot ticking with `if not self.is_sequence_bot_paused(): ...`

#### Grid Mixins and Cursor Serialization
For any game using `GridGameMixin`, serialized grid fields must use Mashumaro-safe canonical types:
- `grid_cursors: dict[str, GridCursor]`
- `grid_row_labels: list[str]`
- `grid_col_labels: list[str]`

Do not replace mixin-owned serialized types with loose tuples or ad-hoc dicts.

#### Touch Client Capability Checks
Use:
- `server/game_utils/client_types.py`
- `is_touch_client(user)`
- `is_touch_client_type(client_type)`
- `uses_self_voicing_settings(user)`

Game logic uses shared touch-client helpers instead of raw `client_type` string checks. Touch-aware action visibility covers:
- `web`
- `mobile`

The menu infrastructure keeps static web-only controls such as the web actions overlay behind explicit web-only guards. Mobile clients do not receive those controls automatically.

#### Web / Mobile UI Consideration (Mandatory)
When implementing a new game, always consider touch clients alongside desktop users.

Rules:
- Time-critical reaction actions must be visible as turn-menu buttons for touch clients during their active windows.
- Utility actions that desktop users access by keybind should also be exposed in the turn menu for touch clients where appropriate.
- Turn menu ordering matters for screen readers and self-voicing clients:
  1. reaction buttons
  2. primary play actions
  3. multi-select confirmation actions
  4. utilities such as draw, pass, sort
- Standard action ordering for touch clients should remain consistent:
  1. game-specific info actions
  2. `check_scores`
  3. `whose_turn`
  4. `whos_at_table`

Use `self._order_touch_standard_actions(action_set, target_order)` for touch standard-action ordering in `create_standard_action_set` and any dynamic `_sync_standard_actions` path. The target list contains the game-specific info actions followed by `check_scores`, `whose_turn`, and `whos_at_table`; the helper preserves other actions above that group and appends only actions that exist. Do not duplicate manual `new_order` or `final_order` loops for this standard-action pattern, and keep desktop ordering separate from touch-only ordering.

#### Spectator Action Visibility (`include_spectators`)
Every `Action` has `include_spectators: bool = False` by default.

Rules:
- `include_spectators=True` only for public information or lobby controls that spectators are meant to use
- `include_spectators=False` for player-private or gameplay-mutating actions
- the `Action` and its matching `Keybind` must agree on spectator visibility

#### Action Set Ordering and Menu Deduplication
`get_all_enabled_actions()` combines action sets in this order:
**turn → lobby → options → standard**

Rules:
- Info/status actions belong in `create_standard_action_set`, not `create_turn_action_set`
- Turn-menu actions that should not appear in the Escape/actions list must use `show_in_actions_menu=False`

#### Keybind State Scoping
`setup_keybinds()` must call `super().setup_keybinds()` first. Gameplay
keybinds use `KeybindState.ACTIVE`, lobby-only actions use `IDLE`, and truly
global actions use `ALWAYS`.

Keybind dispatch is state-scoped: `IDLE` bindings are available only while
`game.status != "playing"`, `ACTIVE` bindings are available only while
`game.status == "playing"`, and `ALWAYS` bindings are available in both states.
Because state is part of the binding scope, the same physical key may be reused
across non-overlapping states. For example, the base `b` Add bot binding is
`IDLE`, so a game may safely bind `b` to an `ACTIVE` gameplay action without
conflicting, as UNO does. Likewise, `enter` can start the game while idle and
select a grid cell while active.

Base/client bindings to respect include `enter`, `escape`, `b`, `shift+b`,
`f3`, `t`, `s`, `shift+s`, `ctrl+m`, `ctrl+q`, `ctrl+u`, `ctrl+s`,
`ctrl+i`, `f1`, and `ctrl+f1`. Plain `F1` is the client-owned
focused-menu-description command and sends `menu_description`, never a game
keybind; `Ctrl+F1` remains How to Play. Do not reuse `ALWAYS` bindings or
same-state base/client bindings for unrelated game-specific actions unless the
behavior is deliberately shared or overridden. When reusing a key across
states, keep the scope explicit, keep matching `Action`/`Keybind` spectator
visibility aligned, and add tests or clear coverage for the intended state
separation.

#### Turn Management Rules
- `set_turn_players(players)` resets `turn_index` to `0`
- `advance_turn()` immediately after `set_turn_players(...)` skips the first player and is almost always wrong
- use `get_active_players()` for gameplay logic, results, and winner calculations

#### Menu Refresh and Focus (Mandatory)
Game code never paints turn menus directly. It records turn-menu intent through
exactly two calls on `MenuManagementMixin`:

- `refresh_menus(player=None)` — mark one player (or everyone) as needing a
  repaint. Recording only; nothing is built or sent here. Over-marking costs
  one set-insert and no packet, so the safe habit — refresh after any state
  change — is also the cheap habit.
- `request_menu_focus(player, action_id)` — queue a one-shot focus jump for
  a player (and mark them for repaint). One slot per player, last writer
  wins, consumed by the next flush that paints that player — so a delayed
  sequence-runner repaint can never double-jump the cursor, and other
  players' repaints never carry the actor's focus.

These per-player entry points are the supported mechanism for strictly
isolated, per-client menu replacement. Use them, or the framework-owned
per-player action-input/status overlays, when an action should change only the
actor's UI: for example, replacing Player A's card list with a "choose suit"
menu while Player B's menu receives no packet at all. This isolation is a
powerful accessibility tool for touch and screen-reader users because it avoids
unrelated focus churn on other clients.

It is not an absolute, always-on rule. Before modifying an existing game or
creating a new one, first understand the full gameplay flow and audience for
the state change. Deliberately classify each menu update:
- private/individual transition: repaint or focus only the affected player;
- public table-state change: refresh every affected player, and use a
  table-wide `refresh_menus()` only when other players' visible choices,
  information, or turn affordances genuinely changed.

Do not blindly convert table-wide refreshes to player-only refreshes, and do
not blindly mark everyone dirty for actor-only choice menus. The correct scope
is part of the game rule/UX design.

One sealed flush point builds and sends: `flush_menus()`, called by the
framework only — at the end of every `Game.handle_event()` and once per
server tick (after game ticks, before the packet flush). Games never call
it; tests call it explicitly at the same boundaries the framework provides
in production (after a direct `execute_action`/`_action_*` call or an
`on_start`/`on_tick` loop, before asserting on menus).

The flush orchestrators — `refresh_menus`, `flush_menus`,
`_paint_player_menu`, `_is_menu_refresh_blocked` — are **sealed**: a game
class that overrides one fails at import time with a `TypeError` (so the
server will not start and pytest will not collect). The flush owns the
focus-steal guards (status boxes, global system menus, pending inputs),
in-place actions-menu refresh, bot skipping, finished-state end screens, and
focus delivery; per-game copies of that logic were the root cause of a long
line of focus-stealing bugs.

Games customize what gets painted through the hooks:
- `before_menu_build(player)` — sync dynamic action sets (per-card play
  actions, standard-action ordering) before any menu paint. Called for bots
  too, so action sets stay valid for bot decisions. Must be idempotent.
  Note that mid-event the action sets are stale (the flush hasn't run yet);
  game code that reads its own action sets right after mutating state should
  call its own `before_menu_build(player)` first (see citadels'
  `_refresh_menus_for_focus`).
- `build_menu_items(player, user) -> MenuBuild` — supply a custom item list
  and grid layout (`MenuBuild(items=..., grid_kwargs=...)`); this is how the
  backgammon and senet boards arrange their grids.

Status overlays are the sanctioned exception: use `status_box(...)` or
`live_status_box(...)` as described below. Games still must not call
`user.show_menu()` / `user.update_menu()` directly.

#### How Clients Treat Menu Packets (Why Plain Refreshes Are Safe)
All three first-party clients treat a menu packet for the menu they are
already displaying as an in-place diff: the cursor follows the focused item
by *identity*, with no announcement and no reset. Focus resets come from
menu-identity changes (turn_menu -> status_box -> turn_menu), from an explicit
`selection_id`, or from a same-menu update where no stable old item survives -
never from a repaint itself. (The old `rebuild_*`-resets /
`update_*`-preserves doctrine was stale; the verb never mattered on any client,
which is why the names are gone.)

Consequences that still matter when designing a menu:
- When the focused item's id leaves the menu, clients fall forward to the next
  surviving item from the old logical order, then backward to the previous
  surviving item, and only then to a clamped numeric fallback. A persistent
  control must stay *present* across refreshes to keep its exact anchor.
- This bit the backgammon board hard. The 24 grid points are a persistent
  grid, but `get_visible_actions` once dropped *disabled* actions — and a
  point disables on the opponent's turn. The off-turn player's board
  collapsed to zero items mid-opponent-turn, destroying the focus anchor
  ("focus teleports to square 13"). The fix was keeping
  disabled-but-visible actions in `get_visible_actions`.
- Where the action list legitimately changes shape and a fixed landing spot
  is preferable, jump focus deliberately with `request_menu_focus` at the
  start of the user's turn — choose one, don't leave focus to chance.
- Focusable informational rows in server-owned menus must use
  `MenuItem(read_only=True)` when they have stable ids. A `MenuItem` without an
  action id is normalized to explicit read-only protocol data automatically;
  do not duplicate that rule with no-op selection-handler branches. Static and
  live status boxes are the deliberate exception: activating any status row is
  their standard close action, so those rows are not read-only controls.
- Server-owned confirmation and consent menus must use
  `server.ui.confirmation.show_confirmation_menu`. The shared helper announces
  the localized prompt and exposes the same prompt as the first stable,
  read-only row. Decision actions follow, with the safe cancel or decline
  action last so Escape always cancels. Do not hand-build Yes/No or
  Accept/Decline menus.
- `NetworkUser` content-diffs repaints: an identical same-menu repaint with
  no focus directive sends no packet at all, and the per-flush coalescer
  collapses same-tick duplicates. Bandwidth is not a reason to avoid
  `refresh_menus()`.
- Open `MenuInput` selectors repaint in place from their current options,
  labels, and descriptions when their player is marked dirty; keep option ids
  semantic and stable so this live update preserves focus. Context-only rows
  use `MenuInput.read_only_options`; the shared builder renders them inert and
  the game event boundary rejects forged activation. Pending
  `EditboxInput` prompts never repaint passively because that would destroy
  typed text. When choosing from a selector must freeze public mutation, set
  `MenuInput(locks_gameplay=True)` and consult `_gameplay_input_lock_owner()`
  from the game's actor/permission checks; do not couple the lock to an action
  id. Information actions may remain available when the game permits them.
- A specialized `MenuInput` surface overrides the idempotent
  `_build_action_menu_input_items(action, player, user, options)` hook instead
  of painting a menu directly. Put announcements and opening sounds in
  `_on_action_menu_input_opened(action, player)`; the builder may run on every
  dirty flush or stale-packet recovery and must be silent. Treat
  `_on_action_input_cancelled(player, action_id)` as cleanup-only: it also runs
  when authoritative state invalidates the input and when a human seat is
  removed or replaced, preventing game-owned draft state from leaking past the
  UI lifecycle.
- The Escape/actions menu is refreshed in place by the sealed flush while it
  is open. Do not block state changes just because a player is reading that
  menu, and do not manually rebuild it from a game.
- Framework-owned exits restore focus to the opener when possible:
  actions-menu Back, actions selected from the actions menu, action-input
  Cancel/submit, leave-confirmation No, status-box close, and server menus
  that close after a selection all use the recorded action context. Games
  should pass stable action ids and avoid ad-hoc focus jumps for these
  standard exits.

#### Static vs. Live Status Boxes
Use the right status-box helper for the job:

- `status_box(player, lines)` is for static snapshots: rules/help text,
  one-shot action results, limited-use private reveals, and information that
  should not change while the player is reading it.
- `live_status_box(player, box_id, builder, focus_id=None)` is for dynamic
  state views that should stay current while open: boards, scoreboards,
  standings, city/hand summaries, battle rosters, clocks, and similar
  gameplay status panels.

Live status boxes are still game overlays using the `status_box` menu id, so
all clients apply the normal same-menu content diff. They repaint only through
the sealed flush path when `refresh_menus()` records a dirty player/all-player
update; identical content is skipped by `NetworkUser`, and passive refreshes
must not pass `selection_id` or `position`. Use `focus_id` only for the initial
direct user action that opens the box.

Global or in-game overlay navigation requested while a status box is open is
deferred by the server and replayed after the status box closes. Active inputs
(`_transient` server editboxes and game `_pending_actions`) still block forward
navigation without queuing it, because completing or cancelling an input can
change the user's intent. In-game overlays such as Host Management must enter
through `_nav_push` or another modal-aware server helper, never by calling a
show function directly from a game action.

Builder rules:
- A live builder receives `(player, user)` and returns `list[str | MenuItem]`
  or `StatusBoxBuild`.
- Prefer `MenuItem` rows with stable semantic ids (`player:<id>`,
  `token:<id>`, `square:<n>`, `score:<team>`) whenever rows can reorder,
  appear, or disappear. String rows get stable fallback ids by line index,
  which is only appropriate for fixed-layout panels.
- Never directly call `user.show_menu()` from games to refresh a status box.
  Update game state, call `refresh_menus()`, and let the framework repaint any
  open live boxes without clobbering turn menus or touch-client focus.

#### Score Management and Units
Shared score display is handled by `GameScoresMixin` and `TeamManager`.

Rules:
- games that use default score actions must keep `TeamManager` synchronized with their authoritative score state
- games with non-point score units must set `score_unit_key` to a localized `game-score-unit-*` key
- score unit keys live in both `server/locales/en/games.ftl` and `server/locales/vi/games.ftl`, unless an existing shared unit key already matches the game
- score unit strings should use Fluent plural/select rules and receive the formatter's `count` value
- games whose target score is not stored as `options.target_score` or `options.winning_score` should override `get_score_target()`
- games with custom non-`TeamManager` scoring should override `supports_score_actions()`, `_action_check_scores`, and `_action_check_scores_detailed` as one coherent set
- scoreless games should not claim score support; their score buttons stay hidden and `s` / `shift+s` are silently ignored
- brief score checks speak one TTS message per player/team in the `game` buffer instead of one combined sentence
- detailed score checks use a live status box with one line per player/team unless the game has a stronger custom detail view
- score units are display text only; leaderboards, ratings, personal statistics, and `GameResult.custom_data` continue to store numeric values in their established schema
- every result for a wins or rating leaderboard declares `winner_ids` using immutable player/account ids; an empty list is a draw and creates neither wins nor losses, and competitive outcomes are never inferred from names
- real teams and games with richer placement data store `RATING_COMPETITORS_KEY` data produced by `rating_competitors_from_scores(...)`; each result participant appears exactly once, equal ranks are ties, and multiple ids in one competitor are actual teammates
- rating calculation is side-effect free; the result, aggregate stats, and validated rating updates commit in one database transaction
- OpenSkill `mu` and `sigma` remain internal model state; player-facing views expose the conservative skill score, leaving visible per-game tiers or placement policy as a separate future presentation layer
- every `PlayerResult` is built through `PlayerResult.from_player(...)`; a disconnected replacement bot remains owned by the reserved account, so its result, stats, win/loss, and rating count for that account and disconnecting cannot dodge a loss; completed substitution transfers ownership to the incoming account; a reversible host kick removes current membership but preserves that UUID-owned seat, private-table reclaim admission, and human-owned roster identity, while kick-and-ban, account deletion, and every other permanent removal immediately rekey an active retained seat to a fresh dedicated-bot UUID; dedicated bots never receive durable player stats or ratings
- startup garbage collection derives valid game types and persisted stat keys from the live game registry, then removes unregistered-game data, unsupported derived leaderboard aggregates, and invalid rating rows; never maintain a parallel hardcoded cleanup schema

#### Team Management and Arrangement
Team-based games use `TeamManager` and the shared lobby team arrangement flow.

Rules:
- games with `TeamModeOption` validate `self.options.team_mode` in `prestart_validate()` with `_validate_team_mode(...)`
- team setup should call `_setup_team_manager_for_start(self.options.team_mode, active_players)` so confirmed host arrangements are preserved and direct `on_start()` calls still auto-assign teams
- team games whose turn sequence depends on team seating should pass `_get_team_turn_players(active_players)` to `set_turn_players(...)` so manual swaps keep the same round-robin balance as automatic assignment
- non-`individual` team modes enter host-controlled team arrangement by default before `on_start()`; override `allows_team_arrangement()` only for games whose rules require fixed or automatic teams
- individual games should not implement their own team-selection menus; shared lobby actions handle reading teams, selecting a member, swapping across teams, cancelling, and confirming
- team arrangement remains a lobby-only state; do not set `status = "playing"` until the host confirms teams and the game actually starts
- roster and option changes during arrangement must be blocked, cancelled, or deliberately refreshed through the shared helpers rather than silently changing teams

#### Persistent Start Action
The `start_game` action remains visible for every user throughout the normal
`waiting` lobby, including while team arrangement is active. Only the host can
execute it. During team arrangement the same stable action id is relabeled as
the localized team-confirmation action; the legacy `confirm_team_arrangement`
action remains executable for compatibility but is not shown as a duplicate.

Readiness must never be implemented by hiding Start. The framework-owned
`validate_start()` enforces minimum, maximum, or exact active-player counts and
then combines those errors with the game's `prestart_validate()` hook. Start
attempts announce all localized validation errors. They do not request focus:
the stable `start_game` item remains present and normal same-menu focus
preservation keeps the cursor in place. Games use `prestart_validate()` only
for their specific deal, ruleset, option-conflict, and team-mode checks.

Every start also requires at least one active human-controlled player. Bots may
satisfy a game's numeric player count, but spectators never satisfy the human
requirement. Keep this rule in shared `validate_start()` so every game reports
the same localized blocker before mutation. If start preparation converts any
disconnected lobby seats to replacement bots, validate the resulting roster
again before team arrangement or `on_start()`. A bot-only roster must remain in
the waiting lobby; do not enter gameplay and depend on abandoned-table cleanup
to destroy it afterward.

Table ownership is independent from gameplay-seat role. A live host who is
spectating retains host controls and may edit declarative game options while
the table is waiting. Once a valid game has started, that host counts as a
human supervisor for disconnect replacement, planned-reboot recovery, and
active-table retention, so bot-controlled seats may continue without forcing
the owner back into a seat. Ordinary spectators never keep an abandoned table
alive. This does not weaken the active-human start requirement. If an active
table reaches zero gameplay seats, preserve it for the present spectator host
but keep gameplay ticks paused until restart or explicit teardown.

Treat the `Table` as the durable party, admission, and LiveKit context and its
`Game` as a replaceable activity. Host-requested game switching validates the
entire live roster and the target game's active-seat capacity before any table
mutation. A successful switch retains the table id, host, privacy, bans, live
human playing/spectating roles, dedicated bots, table chat, and voice context,
but constructs a fresh target lobby with default options. Match state, teams,
readiness, turn timers, scheduled/managed audio, disconnected-seat reclaim
rights, pending substitutions, and invitations that named the old game do not
cross that boundary. Retire the old activity completely, suppress the normal
public table-created notification, rebuild every present member's UI from the
new game, and fail without changing the current table when preparation or
capacity validation fails.

#### Server-Side Navigation Stack
Server menus use the breadcrumb stack in `_user_states[username]["_stack"]`.

Core primitives:
- `_nav_push(user, show_fn, *args)` — forward navigation
- `_nav_back(user)` — go back
- `_nav_refresh(user, show_fn, *args)` — redraw same level without losing history
- `_restore_frame(user, frame, stack)` — centralized state restore

The stack records the item that opened a child menu and restores focus to that
semantic item id when the child exits with Back or an equivalent cancel flow.
Use the navigation helpers rather than direct `_show_*()` calls so focus
memory works consistently across main menus, options, documentation,
leaderboards, statistics, and in-game overlays.
Server-owned menu selections are validated against the currently displayed
menu before dispatch, so stale client packets and forged item ids are ignored
rather than routed into the wrong handler.

Do not call `_show_*()` directly from action handlers. Use `_nav_refresh(...)` so stack history survives.

#### Editbox Input States
Use `_enter_input_state(user, input_id, **extra)` / `server.enter_input_state(...)` instead of mutating `_user_states` directly. This protects the nav stack and modal focus rules.

#### Reconnect and Ghost Cleanup
`_restore_user_state` handles reconnect and cleans up stale lobby membership, spectators, and inconsistent table mappings. Reconnect restoration should always route through the centralized restore flow, not custom menu-specific chains.

Session ownership is the exact `ClientConnection` held by the current
`NetworkUser`, not merely a matching username or authenticated flag. Serialize
authorization, authenticated packet dispatch, disconnect cleanup, and external
security eviction per canonical username. A retired socket's late packet,
queued send, transport-finally callback, or voice event must be harmless to its
successor. Credential verification and account/password deletion or eviction
must share the same account lock so a checked credential cannot become stale
before session activation.

Intentional application exit uses the generic authenticated `logout` packet.
The server runs its ordered session-activity teardown handlers (including table
and voice departure) before retiring the session and sending `force_exit`;
clients must not duplicate game- or room-specific cleanup. Forced process loss
remains an ordinary disconnect because browsers and mobile operating systems
cannot guarantee a final network callback.

First-party releases update the server and all clients in lockstep. Installing
an authenticated session requires an exact client/server version match.
Outdated native clients may receive the credential-verified
`authorize_success` update bootstrap required by the deployed mandatory
updater, but that transport must never own a `NetworkUser`, replace a live
session, emit presence, or dispatch gameplay. Reject outdated Web clients
before authentication. Do not retain obsolete packet-field aliases between
first-party builds. This rule does not remove database, account preference,
local config, table, checkpoint, or saved-game migrations: persisted data
survives a release and must still load safely.

Never copy rendered menus or editboxes across sessions. Rebuild UI from
authoritative server/game intent against the replacement client's capabilities,
normalizing device-only navigation frames to a valid shared parent. A live
device handover keeps authoritative timers and sequences running, replays active
audio layers, preserves reconstructable gameplay overlays, does not substitute
bots or add reconnect grace, and does not reset chat/voice rate limits. Retired
`NetworkUser` output queues are inert, and retained reconnect UI state has a
bounded runtime cleanup lifecycle.

#### Server Alert Broadcast
Scheduled server power alerts use:
- deduplicated task guard
- tiered warning/tick/shutdown sounds
- silent chat packets plus explicit `speak` packets
- reconnect-aware disconnect packets for planned reboots

#### Server Power Management
Server reboot and shutdown flows are framework-owned. Use the centralized
server power manager and developer-only Administration menu; do not add
chat-command reboot/shutdown paths or per-game shutdown hooks.

- Planned reboot preserves active tables through transient checkpoints, freezes
  framework-owned mutation during finalization, skips normal disconnect bot
  substitution, and tells clients to auto-reconnect.
- Planned shutdown clears active table checkpoints and must warn players to
  save games they want to keep before the server goes offline.
- Table checkpoints are transient data with explicit kind, creation time,
  expiration, pruning, account-deletion cleanup, and a one-day TTL unless a
  future migration deliberately changes that lifecycle.
- Post-reboot no-show handling belongs in shared table/game framework logic:
  restored tables get a grace window, then missing active players are replaced
  with bots only when at least one human has returned; tables with no returning
  humans eventually close through abandoned-table cleanup.

#### Database Maintenance
Database backup, cleanup, and compaction are framework-owned reversible
maintenance, not server-power finalization. Route them through
`ServerMaintenanceManager` and the developer-only Database Management menu.

- Database startup is fail-closed. Never move, quarantine, replace, or rebuild
  an existing database automatically after an integrity, identity, version, or
  schema failure. Preserve the main file and sidecars for operator recovery.
- Schema changes require an incremented SQLite `user_version`, the PlayAural
  `application_id`, a full preflight integrity check, and a validated durable
  pre-migration backup before any existing schema is changed. Reject databases
  created by newer server versions. Opening SQLite must never run retention or
  compatibility cleanup; destructive cleanup is an explicit operation.
- Schema version 2 atomically rebuilds legacy `users.username_key` storage so
  version-zero and version-one databases acquire the canonical non-null identity
  contract without losing account ids or rows. Preserve this backed-up migration
  path until those database versions are explicitly retired.
- Schema version 3 compatibility-folds username lookup keys and makes the
  immutable account UUID index unique. Version-two upgrades must remain backed
  up and fail closed if invalid or duplicate account ids are found; never guess
  which account owns corrupted relational data.
- Migration preflight must reserve backup publication and live transaction
  workspace together when both paths share a filesystem. After a rolled-back
  attempt, reuse only a durable pre-migration snapshot whose integrity, schema,
  row counts, and order-independent logical-content digest exactly match the
  unchanged source. A stale, unreadable, partial, or merely same-sized backup is
  never reusable and is never deleted automatically.
- Keep persistence SQL compatible with SQLite 3.25.0 and the SQLite 3.26.0
  runtime shipped by AlmaLinux 8. Current code may use UPSERT and window
  functions, but not newer catalog aliases such as `sqlite_schema` or newer
  maintenance syntax such as `VACUUM INTO`, unless a future migration
  deliberately raises and tests the minimum runtime.
- Current-version validation must reject missing or unexpected tables, columns,
  triggers, and views; malformed declared types, nullability, defaults, and
  primary-key positions; unique-key collations and check constraints; required
  index-definition drift; unexpected named indexes; and foreign-key drift.
  Prefer deriving repeated structural expectations from the canonical creation
  DDL so schema creation and validation cannot silently diverge.
- Connections run in explicit autocommit mode. Every multi-statement mutation
  must use `_transaction()`, normally with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` when its decision
  depends on current rows. Roll back on every exception, close transaction
  cursors, and never silently translate unexpected storage faults into ordinary
  empty/not-found results. Read and status methods must never perform retention
  cleanup as a side effect.
- `SQLITE_IOERR_WRITE` is a fatal operating-system/VFS storage fault, not a
  lock retry. Preserve the database, sidecars, and verified backups; include
  paths, required space, and the SQLite extended result in diagnostics; and
  require the operator to inspect filesystem and mount health, kernel I/O logs,
  user/project quota, process file-size limits, ownership, and SELinux denials
  before retrying. `--database-backup-dir` may target a separate healthy
  filesystem, but the live database filesystem must also pass its migration
  workspace preflight.
- Maintenance capacity checks must verify space that the current service
  identity can actually allocate, not just filesystem-wide free bytes. On
  supported Unix filesystems, use a process-scoped block reservation so user,
  group, or project quotas fail before backup, migration, cleanup, or
  compaction touches authoritative data; never leave probe files behind.
- Production deployment tooling must stop the game service before changing its
  code, dependencies, permissions, or virtual environment. Before startup it
  must restore service-user ownership and private modes on the database,
  sidecars, log, and backup directory; verify durable service-user writes with
  disposable fsync probes outside the database; and bound systemd restart loops
  so persistent startup failures do not repeatedly execute migration or backup
  preparation. Probes never write to or rename authoritative database files.
- Transient table checkpoints remain durable until database validation, schema
  migration, table deserialization, network binding, and tick startup have all
  succeeded. A failed startup must close SQLite and leave checkpoints intact.

- The manager activates one fail-fast exclusive barrier, stops authoritative
  ticks so game clocks, bots, and sequences do not advance, rejects new
  gameplay/account packets while keeping current menus rendered, and drains
  already-tracked handlers before closing the event-loop SQLite connection.
  Ping remains responsive. Login, registration, and password-reset attempts
  must be rejected before database access with a localized maintenance reason.
- Perform blocking SQLite work on a worker thread whose connection is created,
  used, and closed on that same thread. Do not share the event-loop connection
  across threads. Shutdown waits for the worker to release storage before it
  closes transports or touches persistence.
- Read-only storage analysis does not activate the gameplay freeze, but it owns
  the same operation lock and storage-idle barrier. Cancellation, shutdown, and
  scheduled power operations must wait until its worker connection has closed.
- Once a blocking maintenance worker starts, coroutine cancellation cannot stop
  it. Wait for its real terminal outcome: publish success and announce success
  if it completed, propagate its actual error if it failed, and never let
  cancellation hide a post-publication storage-uncertain result.
- Announce each start and terminal outcome directly to every online user with a
  localized `system`-buffer message and notify family sound. Ongoing matches
  remain in memory and resume unchanged after success or a recoverable failure.
- Reopen the live connection and require SQLite identity, schema, structural,
  and foreign-key validation before clearing the barrier or restarting ticks.
  If reopening or validation fails, remain frozen
  and disconnected from SQLite so no gameplay can continue against uncertain
  storage; operator recovery is required.
- Backups use SQLite's online-backup API, unique hidden partial files, exact
  source/destination schema and row-count signatures, full integrity and
  foreign-key checks, file and directory flushes, and same-directory atomic
  rename. The default destination is `server/backups/`, which is excluded from
  source control. A failed backup must not publish a partial snapshot, and the
  next exclusive backup removes fragments older than the shared abandonment
  threshold that were left by an abrupt process loss.
- Compaction first creates and retains a verified safety backup and preflights
  enough free space for both a full staging copy and SQLite's temporary VACUUM
  database. It copies the live database through the backup API, VACUUMs that
  same-directory unpublished candidate in legacy DELETE-journal mode, validates
  its integrity, schema, and logical signature, checkpoints the unchanged
  source, and atomically replaces the authoritative file only at publication.
  Never run VACUUM against the authoritative file. Both paths reject an active
  transaction and concurrent maintenance or power operations. Any failure after
  atomic replacement is storage-uncertain: keep the server frozen and SQLite
  disconnected for operator inspection or recovery from the retained backup.
- A backup captures persistent SQLite state only; active runtime tables are not
  added solely for backup. Backup files are disaster-recovery artifacts kept
  until an operator explicitly removes them. Later account deletion does not
  rewrite historical snapshots, so deployments must restrict access, define an
  operational rotation policy, and keep tested off-host copies.
- Storage cleanup is a separate, explicit, previewable maintenance operation.
  It creates a verified pre-cleanup backup, reevaluates its allowlisted
  candidates inside one atomic transaction, validates the committed database,
  and reports reusable SQLite pages without implicitly running `VACUUM`.
  Saved tables, game results, global-chat history, moderation reports, user
  blocks with valid account owners, compatibility data, valid backups, and logs
  are never cleanup candidates. Saved tables persist until their owner or a
  Developer explicitly deletes them.
- Filesystem cleanup is deliberately narrow: only narrowly named unpublished
  PlayAural backup fragments in the configured backup directory and
  database-specific compaction candidates in the live database directory may
  be removed after the shared abandonment threshold. Never recursively scan or
  delete arbitrary server files, authoritative SQLite sidecars, active logs,
  caches, valid backups, or recovery artifacts from the live administration
  workflow.

#### TTS Buffer Categorization
Every `user.speak_l()` and `broadcast_l()` call must include an explicit `buffer=`:
- `game` — gameplay events
- `system` — settings, connection, moderation, errors, room/system events
- `chat` — shared chat
- `private` — private messages
- `misc` — minor non-chat, non-game informational output

Use `history=False` only for transient UI chrome such as menu-open/close
feedback and one-time selection prompts already represented by the current
interface. Clients must still speak it subject to the selected buffer's mute
state. Errors, gameplay results, and durable information stay in history.

Desktop, Web, and mobile clients share one buffer-mute contract. Muting `all`
makes every buffer effectively muted and prevents individual mute changes until
`all` is unmuted. A directly muted source retains its own bounded runtime
backlog but omits new items from the combined `all` view; unmuting it merges the
retained backlog into `all` in original arrival order without duplicates.
Muting `all` suppresses output without stopping that combined backlog. Effective
Chat and Private Messages mutes suppress both speech and their related
notification sounds. Persist only canonical direct-mute names, never message
history.

Web message history and chat drafts are runtime-only session data. Clear them
when an authenticated session ends or a new login starts, but preserve them
across automatic reconnection for the same authenticated session.

#### Administration Privilege Tiers
`user.trust_level` tiers:
- `1` — user
- `2` — admin
- `3` — dev

Dev-only SMTP configuration is enforced at the menu, routing, and handler levels.

#### Persistence and Data Lifecycle
Any new persistent feature must define:
- what is stored
- how long it lives
- how stale data is cleaned up
- what happens on account deletion
- tests for cleanup behavior

`Game.on_discard()` is the idempotent lifecycle hook for match-scoped caches,
bot observations, and similar memory that must not outlive its game instance.
The framework calls it whenever an instance is abandoned, including table
destruction, restart, game switching, and failed replacement preparation.
Games that launch asynchronous work must cancel it cooperatively here, discard
all job references, run that work only against isolated snapshots, and never
let it call back into a discarded game. This hook does not replace the retention
and cleanup rules required for genuinely persistent data.

#### Chat Anti-Spam and Moderation Reports
- Throttle by immutable account UUID and independent chat scope. Global chat is
  intentionally stricter than table chat, while direct messages use their own
  capacity. Limiter state is runtime-only, survives reconnects, and is removed
  only with account deletion.
- Automated anti-spam may reject only the current spam-shaped send. It must not
  automatically mute, ban, change reputation, or apply another account-level
  penalty. Multiple time-separated incidents may create a System-authored case
  for manual review.
- Coalesce rapid retries into one incident. Enforce a persistent automatic-case
  cooldown per reported UUID and chat scope so reconnects and server restarts
  cannot flood the report queue or online staff alerts. Notify staff only after
  the report transaction commits successfully.
- System reports retain versioned structured detector evidence and one bounded
  rejected-message sample. Like manual reports, they remain until explicit
  review/cleanup, survive target-account deletion as identity snapshots, and
  are included in database backups. Never expose raw evidence JSON in menus.

### Localization
- Use "user" / "người dùng" for account-level entities (presence, profiles,
  friends, blocks, and moderation). Reserve "player" / "người chơi" for
  game-table participants; account lookups must not reuse game-player errors.
- All player-facing strings go through Fluent (`speak_l`, `broadcast_l`,
  `broadcast_personal_l`, and the localized option/pref/sequence helpers). No
  hardcoded English may reach players.
- Pass raw data as kwargs and let Fluent render; do not pre-format strings.
  Use select/plural expressions when output varies by game state.
- Account gender is represented by the canonical `Gender` model in
  `server/gender.py`. Normalize legacy/external reads, reject unsupported
  mutation values, and use unspecified for missing, deleted, unknown, or
  corrupt account data. The database remains authoritative and connected users
  carry the live value; do not serialize this mutable profile field into a game
  or duplicate its lifecycle there.
- Game code resolves gender through `get_player_gender()` and
  `player_localization_kwargs()`. This preserves the live profile value for a
  connected human and looks up a disconnected or bot-controlled human seat by
  immutable account UUID. Synthetic bots are neutral unless deliberately given
  a supported gender for game-owned behavior such as audio selection.
- Identity-bearing Fluent messages use a sibling selector such as
  `$player_gender` and the validated `GENDER_TERM(gender, form, context?)`
  function. Standard game broadcasters infer selectors from `Player` values or
  unique exact player-name kwargs; per-listener custom broadcasters must pass
  their payload through `_resolve_broadcast_kwargs()`. Server-owned account
  messages use the shared gender-kwargs helper rather than duplicating lookup
  logic. Explicit selector kwargs take precedence when a caller intentionally
  describes another identity.
- Gender vocabulary and grammar remain locale data. Use one of the supported
  shared forms; a game that needs distinct terms may pass a bounded context and
  define `<context>-gender-term-<form>` in Fluent. Never branch on language or
  concatenate pronouns in Python. Missing contextual forms fall back to shared
  forms and unspecified/non-binary values fall back to the locale's neutral
  form.
- PlayAural ships English and Vietnamese, and — unlike upstream PlayPalace,
  where translators own everything but `en` — here the agent authors **both**.
  A new or changed `en` key must land with its `vi` counterpart, kept in
  structural parity: same keys, same data-bearing `$variables`, and matching
  plural/select arms. A locale may omit a variable used only as the first
  argument to `GENDER_TERM(...)` when its natural sentence does not need
  gender; if the selector is used, its name must match the source key. Never
  omit names, counts, scores, formatted values, or other player/game data.
- Agent-authored Vietnamese is provisional: write it and keep parity, but flag
  it for native review rather than treating it as final.
- Prefer writing the `en` strings before the game/feature code — it forces the
  flow to be planned and every announcement to be enumerated up front.
- Locale discovery, language selection, and fallback must remain dynamic. Do
  not hardcode feature branches for specific language codes; add new languages
  through locale files and the appropriate metadata/registry layer. Missing
  translated strings and missing translated documentation must fall back to
  English, never to raw keys or empty manuals.
- A live language change sends the client locale update before newly localized
  speech or menus, rebuilds only that player's locale-bound game action sets,
  and restores the semantic parent menu and focus rather than translating a
  rendered surface in place. Desktop and Mobile apply bundled catalogs
  synchronously. Web must place its asynchronous catalog load behind an
  ordered barrier so later WebSocket packets cannot render or speak in front
  of the locale and document-direction update; rapid locale packets must chain
  rather than race.
- Validate server Fluent changes with `server/tools/compare_locales.py`. The
  tool reports missing and obsolete files/keys, plus variable, select/plural
  arm, and attribute mismatches. Obsolete target keys are cleanup work, not
  harmless leftovers.

#### String Localization & Contextual Broadcasting Standard (Mandatory)

Whenever a new game is added or an existing game is modified with
player-facing string changes, the implementation must include a deliberate
audit of every affected string, announcement path, listener perspective, and
reachable state. This is part of the feature work, not optional cleanup.

**Perspective split**
- Every actor-attributable gameplay broadcast must have distinct personal
  first-person and public third-person forms. The actor hears a direct
  "You ..." message; every other listener hears "<PlayerName> ...".
- Use `broadcast_personal_l(...)` when one personal/public pair is sufficient.
  Use an equivalent per-listener localized helper when brief announcements,
  team names, hidden information, locale-dependent values, or other listener
  context requires individual rendering.
- Do not broadcast one third-person message to everyone and make the actor hear
  their own name. Genuinely global events with no actor, such as a round start
  or neutral environmental change, may use one shared form.

**Complete contextual awareness**
- Evaluate affected strings against the full applicable state and audience
  matrix: actor versus observer, individual versus team, success versus
  failure, active versus waiting/resolving state, option and ruleset variants,
  spectators, bots, reconnect/save restoration, and full versus brief
  announcements.
- Include the concrete values that make the event understandable, such as the
  action or object involved, amount gained or lost, resulting total, target,
  remaining requirement, current phase, risk, consequence, or next available
  step. Localize listener-dependent values separately for each recipient.
- Do not reuse a broad string when different branches have materially
  different causes, consequences, private information, or recovery steps.

**Errors, warnings, and action feedback**
- Every disabled-action reason, validation error, warning, confirmation, and
  gameplay notification must identify the attempted action and the specific
  condition that blocked or resulted from it.
- Tell the player what state caused the outcome and, whenever useful, what must
  change or what action is available next. Avoid generic feedback such as
  "Invalid action", "Not allowed", or "You cannot do that" when a precise
  situational explanation can be provided.
- Maintain EN/VI key, variable, plural, and select-arm parity. Add regression
  coverage for actor and observer forms, listener-specific rendering, and the
  important success, failure, edge, and validation branches introduced or
  changed by the work.

### Documentation

When writing or updating documentation, agents must first reference existing
polished project manuals for similar games and match their structure,
formatting, and player-facing style. Documentation is part of the accessible
game experience, not a developer changelog.

- Write for beginners. Use plain, concrete vocabulary, introduce game terms
  before relying on them, and explain what the player does, hears, chooses, and
  wins.
- Cover the practical player manual shape: overview, goal, turn flow, special
  mechanics, scoring or win condition, customizable options with defaults and
  ranges, useful information actions, and game-specific shortcuts where
  relevant.
- Never write manuals like changelogs, patch notes, design notes, or
  implementation summaries. Do not include unnecessary technical development
  details, justifications, or rationale that do not help someone play.
- Keep EN and VI documentation synchronized in structure, meaning, terminology,
  and attribution. Vietnamese manuals should be natural, friendly, and aligned
  with the matching `.ftl` terminology.
- Community translation work must follow `TRANSLATING.md`: preserve variables,
  maintain first-person/third-person key parity, keep documentation
  player-facing, and update language contributor metadata.

### Desktop Client Architecture
- **`client/ui/main_window.py`** — primary desktop UI and gameplay interaction
- **`client/network_manager.py`** — WebSocket client and packet dispatch
- **`client/sound_manager.py`** — sound, music, ambience playback
- **`client/voice_manager.py`** — LiveKit voice lifecycle, microphone publishing, and disconnect cleanup
- **`client/config_manager.py`** — identities, client options, keyring-backed credentials
- **`client/localization.py`** — Fluent runtime localization
- **`client/ssl_utils.py`** — SSL context factory

Desktop rules:
- passwords live only in OS keyring
- client config lives in `identities.json`
- auto-login disables itself on permanent credential failures
- always pass `client_version=VERSION` on every `network.connect()` path
- the desktop voice client runs on its own asyncio loop and must await disconnect/cleanup paths fully
- the saved audio input device is desktop-only state; if a saved microphone is missing on the current machine, the client must fall back to the system default input device

### Web Client Architecture
- **`web_client/game.js`** — version marker and bootstrap entry that imports the modular runtime
- **`web_client/app.js`** — main runtime, auth flow, packet dispatch, menu/input orchestration, speech preferences, and voice-chat coordination
- **`web_client/store.js`** — UI state store for connection state, current menu, capped history buffers, pending input state, and server option data
- **`web_client/network.js`** — WebSocket connection, packet validation, reconnect-safe send handling, and protocol dispatch boundaries
- **`web_client/audio.js`** — browser audio engine for effects, music, ambience, volume/mute state, sound-pack versioning, effect preloading, and stale-effect protection
- **`web_client/generated/soundManifest.js`** — generated asset registry used
  for data-driven numbered sound families
- **`web_client/a11y.js`** — ARIA live announcer with polite/assertive regions and duplicate-announcement guards
- **`web_client/keybinds.js`** — desktop-style keyboard shortcuts, menu navigation, grid movement, buffer controls, and global command routing
- **`web_client/ui/menus.js`** — menu rendering, stable item identity, keyboard/touch selection, grid layout, type navigation, context actions, and iOS-friendly pointer activation
- **`web_client/ui/history.js`** — capped/coalesced history rendering, buffer switching, screen-reader announcements, and mobile history presentation
- **`web_client/locales/manifest.js`**, **`web_client/locales/index.js`**, and locale catalog files — client-side locale metadata, dynamic loading, and UI strings
- **`web_client/sw.js`** — PWA service worker and static shell cache

Web rules:
- never use `innerHTML` with server-controlled content
- remember-me password storage is opt-in and controlled by `pa_remember`
- TTS, Web Speech queues, audio handles, voice chat, pending inputs, and reconnect
  state must be cleaned up on disconnect
- current client version is tracked in `web_client/game.js`
- server `request_input` packets determine single-line versus multiline web
  controls through `multiline`; single-line input submits with Enter, multiline
  follows the desktop Enter behavior and still auto-selects default text
- ARIA live regions belong at the bottom of the reading order, while game focus
  remains bounded to menu/history/chat targets during play
- history buffers are capped and render work is coalesced; do not reintroduce
  unbounded per-message DOM rebuilds
- desktop and Web visual history follows newly rendered messages to the bottom
  without stealing the reader's caret or focus. Compact Web history remains
  collapsible, focus-safe, and opens at the newest rendered message
- Web Speech voice selection exposes a Default Voice option and stores browser
  voice values through stable client-generated menu ids
- menu selection sounds, typing sounds, and action sounds should preload when
  possible and must not delay touch menu activation
- browser game audio uses a playback audio session so iOS does not silence Web
  Audio with the hardware mute switch. Switch to `play-and-record` only while
  the user explicitly publishes a voice-chat microphone, then restore playback.
  Recover previously running contexts after foregrounding without consuming the
  initial user gesture, and retain the lazy Ogg Vorbis decoder fallback for
  browsers that cannot decode the shipped container natively
- table voice chat lives in the Chat area and must keep browser permission handling, ARIA announcements, and voice cleanup in sync with table lifecycle packets

### Mobile Client Architecture
- **`mobile_client/src/app/PlayAuralApp.tsx`** — main app shell, auth flow, overlays, focus state
- **`mobile_client/src/network/PlayAuralConnection.ts`** — WebSocket connection and packet handling
- **`mobile_client/src/audio/MobileAudioManager.ts`** — sound, music, ambience, fade, and crossfade handling
- **`mobile_client/src/tts/TtsManager.ts`** — self-voicing speech manager
- **`mobile_client/src/state/BufferStore.ts`** — message buffers/history
- **`mobile_client/src/gestures/useSelfVoicingGestures.ts`** — gesture recognizer for self-voicing mode
- **`mobile_client/locales/en/client.json`** / **`mobile_client/locales/vi/client.json`** — mobile UI strings
- **`mobile_client/sounds/`** — bundled sound pack copied directly from the desktop layout

Mobile rules:
- the client connects as `client: "mobile"`
- it is treated as a touch client, not as `web`
- it is currently CAPTCHA-exempt like the desktop client
- local config/preferences are persisted with AsyncStorage
- credentials are stored in SecureStore
- Back resolves the visible dialog/input before local tabs or server menus;
  same-menu updates retain the server's escape behavior
- In self-voicing mode, a three-finger single tap requests the focused menu
  description. Defer it through the recognizer's shared multi-finger multi-tap
  window and cancel it as soon as another gesture chord starts so it never
  fires during the global three-finger triple-tap toggle.
- boards scroll on both axes without shrinking touch targets below the UI
  minimum; self-voicing focus reveals the selected cell without delaying cursor
  or speech updates. Android boards use one native two-axis gesture owner and
  accessibility scroll surface; verify TalkBack two-finger panning and native
  directional scroll actions
- message buffers are bounded runtime-only state with stable message focus;
  returning to login clears every buffer and the chat draft. Never persist
  message history with account settings
- saved credentials support auto-login with graceful fallback to manual login
- version and sound-pack mismatches trigger a mandatory APK update prompt
- the production default server URL is `wss://playaural.ddt.one:443`
- mobile speech preferences use `mobile_tts_engine`, `mobile_tts_voice`, and `mobile_tts_rate`
- web speech preferences use `speech_mode`, `speech_voice`, and `speech_rate`
- browser web-runtime tests expose browser/Web Speech voices, while Android builds expose device TTS voices through Expo Speech
- unavailable synced mobile voices or engines must fall back to the system default without throwing
- native speech stop/start operations are serialized and speech waits for engine
  readiness. Failed bindings use bounded, configurable recovery; stale speech
  callbacks and voice discovery cannot affect a replacement engine. Completion
  follows native callbacks/playback state, never text-duration estimates.
- retain the guarded `expo-speech` lifecycle patch and Android `buildFromSource`
  entry. Stopping clears pending startup speech; teardown clears readiness and
  allows a later binding. The engine uses media audio without acquiring focus
  or overriding the system output route.
- screen-reader events are subscribed before the initial query and reconciled
  on foreground/Android focus return. Older queries cannot overwrite newer
  events. Detection never changes the saved self-voicing preference; UI speech
  and game announcements retain separate ownership during handoffs.
- mobile locale catalogs are loaded through `mobile_client/src/i18n/localeCatalogs.ts`; update `mobile_client/locales/metadata.json` and run `cmd /c npm run generate:locales` when adding a mobile language
- server locale directories must include `metadata.json` for translator credit
  and official/community status. Keep `languages.ftl` for viewer-localized
  language names; metadata complements it and does not replace it.

### Game Counts and Catalog
The server currently registers **51 games**:
- category ids are `cards`, `dice`, `board`, `poker`, `arcade`, and `misc`
- the Play menu exposes a persisted category filter with dynamic per-category game counts
- games usually expose one category through `get_category()`, while `get_categories()` supports future multi-category games
- recent additions include `Flip 7`, `Zombie Dice`, `Dead Man's Dice`, `Skip-Bo`, `Bingo`, `Metal Pipe`, `Nine`, `Senet`, `Cards Against Humanity`, `21`, `Age of Heroes`, `UNO`, `Exploding Kittens`, `BANG! The Bullet`, and `Monopoly`

### Key Tech Stack
- Python 3.11, `asyncio`, `websockets>=12.0`, `mashumaro`, `fluent-runtime`, `openskill`, `argon2-cffi`
- Desktop: `wxPython`, `accessible-output2`, `Cosmos` (miniaudio and Steam Audio), `keyring`, `livekit`, `sounddevice`
- Mobile: `expo`, `react-native`, `expo-audio`, `expo-speech`, `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`, `expo-secure-store`
- Package manager: `uv` for Python components, `npm` for the mobile client
- Languages: English and Vietnamese are official defaults; partial community translations fall back to English
