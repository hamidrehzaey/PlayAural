# AGENTS.md - PlayAural AI Development Guide

Concise mandatory rules for AI agents working on PlayAural. `CLAUDE.md` is the
detailed source of truth; keep this file synchronized with it. If the two ever
conflict, follow `CLAUDE.md` and update `AGENTS.md`.

## Project

PlayAural is an audio-first multiplayer gaming platform for screen reader users.
It is licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later and has four first-party components:

- `server/`: Python 3.11 asyncio WebSocket server, games, auth, tables,
  persistence, localization, ratings, voice authorization.
- `client/`: Python wxPython desktop client with keyboard/screen-reader UX.
- `web_client/`: modular vanilla JS PWA with ARIA live output, keyboard and
  touch menu navigation, capped history buffers, browser audio/Web Speech, and
  table voice chat.
- `mobile_client/`: Expo/React Native/TypeScript Android-first touch and
  self-voicing client.

All gameplay communication is WebSocket JSON packets. Table voice chat is
server-authorized but media flows through the separate LiveKit service. Never
merge voice media into gameplay WebSocket traffic. Voice membership is
runtime-only table state unless a future feature explicitly defines retention,
cleanup, and account-deletion behavior.
Focused menu help uses the semantic `menu_description` request with the current
menu and stable item ids. The server validates both against the visible menu;
never route this UI command through gameplay keybind dispatch.
Server-requested voice joins reuse `voice_join_info` with
`server_requested=true`; clients connect listen-only and must never enable the
microphone without a separate explicit user action. `voice_context_closed`
cancels both pending and active joins.
Live device handover carries confirmed table-voice listening intent through a
fresh context-bound server request without broadcasting a false leave/join
pair. Never transfer a microphone or device selection; the replacement client
starts listen-only, and only an unexpired continuation grant may survive a
rapid second handover. Keep confirmed presence during that bounded grant;
successful reconfirmation is silent, while client rejection, media-connection
failure, or grant expiry clears it and announces one real disconnect. Clients
must revoke failed join grants, and the server must close late confirmations.
Table voice controls are keyed only by immutable account UUID. Host microphone
moderation is server-authoritative and must update both the table policy and
LiveKit publish permission; client microphone locks are defense in depth, not
the authority. Personal mute and volume are listener-private mixer state. Both
are checkpoint-only properties of the durable table: preserve them across a
game switch and server restore, preserve settings *about* a departed target so
they apply if that account rejoins, clear preferences owned by a listener when
that listener leaves the table, and clear everything when the table is
destroyed. Never persist these controls in a manual saved game or key them by
username, display name, participant label, or seat.
`clear_ui` clears server-owned menus and inputs only; table context and unified
audio/voice lifecycle packets own runtime teardown.

User blocks are directional persistent records retained until explicit
unblocking or either account is deleted. Any block between two accounts is a
mutual direct-contact barrier: it blocks friend requests, private messages,
table invites, ordinary text chat delivery, and presence notifications in both
directions. Applying a block atomically removes their friendship, requests in
either direction, and queued social notifications. It does not remove players
from shared tables, prevent reserved-seat recovery, or mute table voice chat.
It does prevent either account from newly entering a table hosted by the other
or being brought together by manually restoring a saved table; later host
transfer never evicts an existing participant. Optional global notifications
attributable to a blocked account, such as table creation, are also suppressed.
Enforce these boundaries in shared database/server handlers, not only through
menu visibility. Manual saved-table restoration is owner-scoped and
all-or-nothing: validate the complete game/member payload and current social
admission before creating a table, preserve the save on every failure, and
give actionable unblock guidance only for blocks the restorer controls.

Account identity has three distinct roles. The database UUID is the immutable,
globally unique account id and owns sessions, relationships, moderation targets,
statistics, and every other durable relation. The username is an immutable,
unique login/routing handle; it is currently also the public label, but must
never be rewritten as a display-name change. A future `display_name` is mutable,
non-unique presentation data only: resolve it through the UUID/username owner,
never authenticate, authorize, route, join, or persist a relation by it. Stored
chat, report, and result names are deliberate historical snapshots paired with
immutable ids, not live identity keys. Server-owned identity names are reserved
through the shared registry and cannot be registered by users. When display
names are introduced, identity-sensitive profiles, reports, moderation views,
and confirmations must expose the owning username, while every action id and
payload remains bound to the UUID.

Bot identity is likewise structural, never name-derived. `Player.id` and
`Player.is_bot` are authoritative; `bot_name_base` is serialized presentation
data used to preserve a bot's personality across save/load. Localized base
names may match usernames or other bot bases. Every production bot must expose
a collision-free table label: use the bare base while it is unique, add the
localized bot marker only while a human or another bot shares that base, and
add a stable ordinal when multiple bots share it. A replacement bot retains the
disconnected human's account UUID and reclaim metadata. Reconcile labels across
joins, leaves, replacements, reconnects, and save/load. Never reserve localized
bot bases from registration, infer bot status from text, or route an action by
an unqualified base name.

## Commands

Run server tests from the repo root through uv:

```bash
uv run --project server --extra dev python -m pytest server/tests -q
uv run --project server --extra dev python -m pytest server/tests/test_file.py::test_name
```

Run focused tests while iterating. Run the full suite before landing
cross-subsystem changes or features. Tests are parallel-safe with `-n auto`;
keep new tests deterministic and avoid RNG-dependent exact assertions.

Other common commands:

```bash
cd server && python -m server
python client/client.py
python -m http.server 8080 --directory web_client
node web_client/scripts/generate-sound-manifest.mjs
npm --prefix web_client run test:history
cd mobile_client && cmd /c npm install && cmd /c npm run generate:sounds && cmd /c npm run generate:locales
cd mobile_client && cmd /c npm run typecheck && npx expo start
```

## Core Architecture

- `server/games/` currently registers 51 games. Categories are `cards`, `dice`,
  `board`, `poker`, `arcade`, and `misc`; user-facing category labels must be
  localized. The Play menu uses dynamic counts, not hardcoded category counts.
- Games are `@dataclass` classes registered with `@register_game`, inherit from
  `Game`, and may add utility mixins such as `GridGameMixin` or
  `TurnTimerMixin`.
- Persistent game state must be dataclass fields serialized safely by
  Mashumaro. Runtime-only state belongs in `__post_init__`.
- Use the canonical `Player` and `ActionContext` types from
  `server/game_utils/` or the `server/games/base.py` re-exports. Do not create
  duplicate base player/context classes.
- Every game implements metadata methods including `get_name`, `get_type`,
  `get_category`, player bounds, and `get_supported_leaderboards`.
- Use `get_active_players()` for gameplay, results, and winner logic. Do not
  iterate `self.players` for active-player decisions unless spectators/bots are
  deliberately included.
- `set_turn_players(players)` resets `turn_index` to 0. Do not call
  `advance_turn()` immediately afterward.
- `on_tick()` must call `super().on_tick()`, process scheduled sounds, process
  sequences, and gate bot logic when sequences pause bots.

## Timed Flows

Use `SequenceRunnerMixin` for delayed gameplay/audio flows that must survive
save/load: movement animations, reveals, captures, roulette, cutscenes, and any
legacy event-queue style flow.

Rules:

- Build explicit `SequenceBeat` lists with `sound_op`, `localized_sound_op`,
  and `callback_op`.
- Use `SequenceBeat.after_audio(duration_ticks, wait_ratio=...)` when the next
  beat should overlap a measured asset; the ratio delays the following beat,
  so add a following beat when the sequence must remain active. Keep duration
  data-driven instead of hardcoding replacement-sensitive delays.
- State changes happen in callbacks, not because a sound played.
- Payloads must be Mashumaro-safe primitives, lists, dicts, or safe dataclasses.
- Prefer `SEQUENCE_LOCK_GAMEPLAY`; keep info/status actions available.
- Use `pause_bots=True` when bots must wait.
- Cancel stale tagged sequences when resetting a phase or round.

## Grid Games

For `GridGameMixin`, serialized fields must use exact safe types:

- `grid_cursors: dict[str, GridCursor]`
- `grid_row_labels: list[str]`
- `grid_col_labels: list[str]`

Do not store raw tuples or ad-hoc cursor dicts in serialized grid state.

## Actions, Menus, and Focus

Action sets resolve in this order: `turn -> lobby -> options -> standard`.

- Turn-menu gameplay actions use `show_in_actions_menu=False`.
- Game-specific info/status actions belong in `create_standard_action_set`, not
  the turn set.
- `Action.include_spectators` and matching keybind `include_spectators` must
  agree.
- Public information may use `include_spectators=True`; private or mutating
  gameplay actions normally must not.

Game code does not paint turn menus directly. It records turn-menu intent with:

- `refresh_menus(player=None)`: mark one player or everyone dirty.
- `request_menu_focus(player, action_id)`: one-shot focus jump for one player.

Per-client isolated rendering is supported and important for individualized
flows: use `refresh_menus(player)`, `request_menu_focus(player, action_id)`, or
framework-owned per-player input/status overlays when only that player should
see a menu replacement. This is a deliberate tool, not an always-on rule.
Before modifying or creating a game, understand the gameplay flow and decide
whether a change is private to the actor or reflects public table state. Use
strict per-player isolation for private/action-specific transitions such as
choosing a suit after a card play; use table-wide refreshes when other players'
visible choices or public information genuinely changed.

Status overlays are the sanctioned exception: use `status_box(...)` for static
snapshots and `live_status_box(...)` for dynamic state panels. Games still must
not call `user.show_menu()` / `user.update_menu()` directly.
Server navigation requested while a status box is open is deferred and replayed
after the box closes; active editbox/action-input states block navigation
without queuing it. In-game overlays such as Host Management must enter through
modal-aware server navigation, not direct show calls from game actions.

`flush_menus()` is sealed and framework-owned. Games must not override or call
menu flush internals except tests calling `flush_menus()` at production
boundaries after direct `execute_action`, `_action_*`, `on_start`, or `on_tick`.
Do not resurrect old `rebuild_*` / `update_*` patterns.

Customize painting through:

- `before_menu_build(player)`: idempotently sync dynamic action sets and order.
- `build_menu_items(player, user) -> MenuBuild`: custom item/grid layout.

Client focus doctrine:

- Same-menu repaint preserves focus by item id; if the focused item leaves the
  menu, clients fall forward to the next surviving item from the old logical
  order, then backward to the previous surviving item, and only then to a
  clamped numeric fallback. `NetworkUser` skips identical same-menu repaints
  with no focus directive.
- Anchors reset only when the menu identity changes, no stable old item
  survives, or `selection_id` explicitly jumps focus.
- Keep disabled-but-visible persistent controls when they anchor touch or screen
  reader focus. Use `request_menu_focus` only for deliberate action-driven jumps.
- Informational server-menu rows use `MenuItem(read_only=True)` when they need
  stable ids. Rows without action ids normalize to explicit read-only protocol
  data automatically; do not add no-op handler branches for them. Status-box
  rows are the intentional exception because activating any row closes the box.
- Server-owned confirmation and consent menus use
  `server.ui.confirmation.show_confirmation_menu`. It announces the localized
  prompt and renders that same prompt as the first stable read-only row, then
  places decision actions after it with the safe cancel/decline action last so
  Escape cancels. Do not hand-build Yes/No or Accept/Decline menus.
- Open `MenuInput` selectors repaint live through sealed flushes; use stable
  option ids and declare contextual non-actions through `read_only_options`.
  Pending `EditboxInput` prompts do not repaint passively. If a
  selector must freeze public mutations, declare `locks_gameplay=True` and use
  `_gameplay_input_lock_owner()` in the game's actor/permission checks rather
  than hardcoding its action id; information actions may remain available.
  Specialized selectors override the idempotent
  `_build_action_menu_input_items(...)` hook; one-time TTS or sound belongs in
  `_on_action_menu_input_opened(...)` so passive/stale-event repaints stay
  silent. `_on_action_input_cancelled(...)` must only clean game-owned draft
  state because the framework also calls it when an input becomes stale or its
  human seat is removed/replaced.
- The Escape/actions menu auto-refreshes in place through sealed
  `flush_menus()`. Games must not repaint or block it manually.
- Framework-owned exits restore focus to the opener when possible: actions-menu
  Back, actions selected from the actions menu, action-input Cancel/submit,
  leave-confirmation No, status-box close, and server menus that close after a
  selection. Use stable action ids so this works.
- Use `status_box(player, lines)` for static snapshots/help/limited reveals.
  Use `live_status_box(player, box_id, builder, focus_id=None)` for dynamic
  state panels such as boards, standings, clocks, rosters, and detailed scores.
  Live builders return strings or `MenuItem`s, refresh only through the sealed
  flush after `refresh_menus()`, and must use stable semantic item ids whenever
  rows can reorder, appear, or disappear.

## Touch Clients

Use `server/game_utils/client_types.py` helpers (`is_touch_client`,
`is_touch_client_type`, `uses_self_voicing_settings`) instead of raw
`client_type` checks. Touch clients include web and mobile; mobile is not web.

Rules:

- Time-critical reaction actions must be visible in the turn menu during active
  windows for touch clients.
- Utility actions normally reached by desktop keybinds should be touch-visible
  when useful.
- Turn order for touch menus: reactions, primary card/tile/play actions,
  multi-select confirmation, utilities.
- Touch standard-action order: game-specific info, `check_scores` if supported,
  `whose_turn`, `whos_at_table`.
- Use `_order_touch_standard_actions(action_set, target_order)`; do not copy
  manual ordering loops. Keep desktop ordering separate.
- In mobile self-voicing mode, a three-finger single tap requests the focused
  menu description. Defer it through the recognizer's shared multi-finger
  multi-tap window and cancel it when another chord starts so it never fires
  during the global three-finger triple-tap toggle.

## Keybinds

`setup_keybinds()` must call `super().setup_keybinds()` first. Gameplay
keybinds use `KeybindState.ACTIVE`; lobby-only actions use `IDLE`; truly global
actions use `ALWAYS`.

Keybinds are scoped by state. The same physical key may be reused across
non-overlapping states when the actions cannot both be active. For example, the
base `b` Add bot binding is `IDLE`, so a game may safely bind `b` to an
`ACTIVE` gameplay action, as UNO does. Likewise, `enter` can start a lobby game
while idle and select a grid cell while active.

Base/client bindings to respect: `enter`, `escape`, `b`, `shift+b`, `f3`, `t`,
`s`, `shift+s`, `ctrl+m`, `ctrl+q`, `ctrl+u`, `ctrl+s`, `ctrl+i`,
`f1`, `ctrl+f1`. Plain `F1` is the client-owned focused-menu-description
command and must send the semantic `menu_description` request, never a game
keybind; `Ctrl+F1` remains How to Play. Do not reuse `ALWAYS` bindings or
same-state base/client bindings for unrelated game-specific actions unless
deliberately matching the standard behavior. When reusing a key across states,
keep the scope explicit and add coverage for the intended separation.

## Options

Use declarative `GameOptions` with `option_field()`.

- Every option must have working logic; no dead options.
- Every option needs a localized `change_msg` in EN and VI.
- `MenuOption` needs `choice_labels` for every raw value.
- `TeamModeOption` uses shared team-mode helpers.
- The framework keeps `start_game` visible throughout the waiting lobby.
  `validate_start()` owns player-count checks and combines them with the game's
  `prestart_validate()` errors; never hide Start merely because setup is
  invalid.
- Every start requires at least one active human-controlled player. Bots may
  satisfy a game's numeric player count, but spectators do not satisfy this
  human requirement. Reject bot-only starts in shared validation and recheck
  after disconnected lobby seats are converted to replacement bots; never
  enter gameplay and rely on abandoned-table cleanup to reject the match.
- Table ownership is independent from gameplay-seat role. A present host who
  is spectating retains host controls and may change waiting-lobby options. In
  an already-started game, that host may supervise bot-controlled seats and
  keeps the table alive; an ordinary spectator never does. This exception does
  not permit a bot-only start. If no active seat remains, retain the table but
  keep gameplay paused until the host restarts or closes it.
- Treat a table as the durable social and voice session and its `Game` as a
  replaceable activity. A host game switch must validate the complete live
  roster and target capacity before mutation, then keep the table id, host,
  privacy, bans, live human roles, dedicated bots, and voice context while
  creating a fresh target lobby. Do not carry match options, teams, readiness,
  timers, reclaim rights for disconnected seats, or activity-bound consent;
  stop and detach all old-game runtime state, cancel old-game invitations, and
  suppress the ordinary new-public-table notification.
- `prestart_validate()` must block impossible deals, unsupported option
  combinations, and team-mode conflicts with clear localized errors.

## Audio and Accessibility

Audio-first is mandatory. Every important state change needs TTS and/or sound.

- Every `speak_l()` and `broadcast_l()` call must pass explicit `buffer=`.
- Buffers: `chat` for shared chat, `private` for private messages, `game` for
  gameplay, `system` for settings/connection/moderation, and `misc` for minor
  non-game informational output.
- Use `history=False` only for transient UI chrome such as menu-open/close
  feedback and one-time selection prompts already represented by the current
  interface. Clients must still speak it subject to the selected buffer's mute
  state. Errors, gameplay results, and durable information stay in history.
- Desktop, Web, and mobile share one buffer-mute contract. Muting `all` makes
  every buffer effectively muted and blocks individual mute changes until it is
  unmuted. A directly muted source retains its bounded runtime backlog but
  omits new items from `all`; unmuting it merges that retained backlog into
  `all` in original arrival order without duplicates. A global mute keeps the
  combined backlog. An effective Chat or Private Messages mute suppresses
  speech and its related notification sounds. Persist only canonical
  direct-mute names, never message history.
- Use `play_sound`, `user.play_sound`, `play_music`, ambience helpers, scheduled
  sounds, or sequences as appropriate.
- Sound-pack version increments are maintainer-controlled release actions.
  Never bump a sound-pack version merely because audio assets or generated
  manifests changed. Change version markers only when the project maintainer
  explicitly requests a bump; otherwise preserve them when adding, replacing,
  converting, normalizing, or regenerating audio assets.
- All server-driven SFX, music, and ambience use the versioned `audio` command
  contract in `server/audio.py`. Do not add separate packet types or
  client-specific routing. Asset paths and command values must be validated.
- Optional 3D positions use listener-relative `(x, y, z)` coordinates with the
  listener at the origin facing `+Y`. The server is the positioning authority
  and derives ordinary pan from the same point for non-HRTF fallbacks. Desktop,
  Web, and native mobile playback consume the same spatial contract. Use a
  fixed position for a point event, atomic `segments` for a finite multi-stage
  sound, and stable-handle `update` commands for a replayable moving source.
- One-shot notification SFX may declare their related output `buffer`; clients
  suppress those cues when that buffer is effectively muted. Do not attach a
  buffer to managed or looping audio.
- Randomized numbered one-shot SFX use the validated `family` field. Clients
  select from dynamically discovered `<family><positive integer>` assets; do
  not hardcode a variant count or use families for loops, music, or ambience.
- Finite multi-stage SFX use one atomic `play` command with complete `segments`
  and a stable handle. Clients validate and preload every asset before starting,
  then schedule each onset from decoded frame counts, pitch, and the validated
  per-segment next-onset ratio on a shared audio clock. A ratio of `1` is
  contiguous; a smaller ratio overlaps authored tails without altering pitch,
  and authored silence remains part of the asset. Segment motion spans that
  segment's decoded duration. Renderers keep every overlapping HRTF tail
  connected until it has finished rather than clipping it at the last decoded
  frame. Never approximate these chains with
  separate packets, server ticks, or replacement-sensitive duration constants.
  Any load or scheduling failure cancels the whole chain, and finite sequences
  remain runtime-only rather than entering `active_audio` replay state.
- Positioned `play` commands may carry a complete `attenuation` object using
  `none`, `linear`, `inverse`, or `exponential`. Active curves always include
  reference/maximum distance, rolloff, and minimum/maximum gain; clients must
  reject partial or out-of-range objects. Omission and explicit `none` both
  spatialize without volume falloff. Evaluate the versioned formulas in the
  shared mixer exactly once and keep renderer/backend distance gain neutral.
- Replayable positioned sources move through a stable-handle `update` command
  carrying complete origin/destination positions, integer duration/elapsed
  milliseconds, and a named easing curve. The server advances and persists
  authoritative trajectory state; clients interpolate on their audio clocks.
  Reconnect resumes from persisted elapsed state, while stop and replacement
  generations cancel stale interpolation. Never persist process clock values.
- Looping SFX use stable handles and explicit stop; music supports fade
  pause/resume/stop; ambience uses independent `global`, `player`, or `context`
  scope plus a stable layer. Switching music or one ambience layer crossfades
  without disturbing unrelated layers.
- Stable handles are client-global. Server replay state must mirror handle and
  layer replacement exactly; never leave two overlapping sources that one
  recipient's client cannot own simultaneously. Reject a private operation
  that would partially replace public replay state.
- `play` may set an independent normalized source gain. Stable-handle `update`
  may automate source gain, position, or both concurrently. Keep authored
  volume, source gain, attenuation, fade envelope, bus/duck gain, and user
  master volume as separate mixer stages. Persist current replayable gain and
  unfinished automation, never process-clock timestamps.
- Environmental boundary blends keep independent ambience layers playing and
  phase coherent. Convert normalized zone weights to linear or equal-power
  source-gain targets; do not restart stems. Zero-gain layers remain active
  until explicit lifecycle teardown.
- Ambience stems may define any combination of intro, loop, and outro assets.
  With seamless stem playback, intro-to-loop and loop-to-outro are contiguous
  boundaries with no fade or crossfade; fades apply only to starting, replacing,
  pausing, or forcibly stopping independent sources. An ambience stop uses an
  immediate no-fade loop-to-outro splice by default so long loops cannot leak
  across a game or table teardown. Use `outro_mode="boundary"` only when the
  caller deliberately accepts finishing the current loop iteration at its
  authored seam. Waiting lobbies never own background music. Game completion
  and reset retire every replayable layer: ambience may finish through its
  authored outro, while already-playing one-shot result cues may complete.
  Table exit uses `stop_all` with `play_outros=True`. Reconnect replay joins the
  loop and never repeats an already-heard intro.
- Named buses, priority/max-instance limits, and source-lifetime ducking are
  protocol data, not game/client hardcoding. User volume remains the master.
  Async loads and fades must be generation-guarded against stale resurrection.
- Cross-client attenuation and automation math must use the shared protocol-v3
  conformance vectors at the repository root. Extend that corpus when formulas
  or easing curves change; do not copy independent expected values into each
  client suite.
- Ducking is a dormant, opt-in capability. Do not add `ducking` to first-party
  gameplay commands until a future feature deliberately enables and tunes it;
  keep zero-duck defaults behaviorally identical to an engine without ducking.
- Positioned native mobile playback uses the local Cosmos/miniaudio Expo module
  and the complete official Steam Audio 4.8.1 artifact set. Treat its platform
  libraries, headers, licenses/notices, and SHA-256 manifest as one update.
  `postinstall` must fail closed on version, hash, ABI, or Android 16 KiB
  alignment drift. Preserve partial frames and HRTF tails across arbitrary
  device callback sizes. Reserve bounded source capacity and collision-free IDs
  before async creation, and release them on every failure or lifecycle exit.
  iOS Simulator must use the explicit non-HRTF platform fallback.
- Android playback must preserve the system-selected wired, Bluetooth, or
  speaker route; game-audio setup must never force speakerphone routing. Keep
  ExpoAV as the single audio-focus coordinator, and retain the guarded
  `expo-audio` native routing patch applied by the mobile `postinstall` script.
  Android must build `expo-audio` from that guarded local source, not its
  otherwise-unpatched precompiled artifact.
- Mobile LiveKit voice must remain media-quality audio. Android uses
  `MODE_NORMAL`, `STREAM_MUSIC`, `USAGE_MEDIA`, no forced output selection, and
  no LiveKit focus lease even while publishing the microphone. iOS disables
  LiveKit's automatic call profile: listening uses `playback`/`default`, while
  explicit microphone publishing uses `playAndRecord`/`default`, never
  `voiceChat` or `videoChat`; keep stereo Bluetooth A2DP available but exclude
  the mono hands-free profile. Retain the guarded LiveKit iOS native patch and
  its fail-closed postinstall tests.
- Persist only replayable layers in `active_audio` with recipient and paused
  state. It follows the containing table/save retention and deletion lifecycle;
  explicit stops, resets, transfers, and replacements prune stale state.
  One-shots and mixer state are runtime-only. Gameplay WebSockets carry audio
  control JSON only; LiveKit remains the separate voice-media path.
- Provide information actions for state queries such as hand, board/table,
  counts, status, scores, and whose turn.

## Localization

All player-facing strings go through Fluent. No hardcoded English may reach
players.

Use "user" / "người dùng" for account-level entities (presence, profiles,
friends, blocks, and moderation). Reserve "player" / "người chơi" for game-table
participants; do not reuse game-player error strings for account lookups.

- Use `speak_l`, `broadcast_l`, `broadcast_personal_l`, localized option/pref
  helpers, and localized sequence helpers.
- Pass raw data as kwargs and let Fluent format lists, plurals, and selects.
- Account gender uses the canonical `Gender` model in `server/gender.py`.
  Normalize values read from legacy or external data, reject unsupported
  mutation values, and default missing/deleted/unknown accounts to unspecified.
  Keep this mutable profile field on live users and in the account database;
  never duplicate it into serialized game state.
- Games query `get_player_gender()` / `player_localization_kwargs()` so
  disconnected and bot-controlled human seats resolve by immutable account ID.
  Localized identity references use validated sibling variables such as
  `$player_gender` with `GENDER_TERM(...)`; standard game broadcasters infer
  these variables from `Player` values or unique player names. Direct server
  messages must supply them with the shared gender-kwargs helper.
- Grammar and game-specific forms belong in locale data, not language branches.
  Use a supported shared `GENDER_TERM` form and, only when a game needs its own
  vocabulary, an allowlisted context backed by
  `<context>-gender-term-<form>`. Unspecified and non-binary values use the
  locale's neutral fallback.
- Maintain EN/VI parity: same keys, data-bearing variables, and plural/select
  arms. A locale may omit a variable used only as a `GENDER_TERM(...)`
  selector when its natural sentence does not need gender; if used, the
  selector name must still match the source key.
- Agents author both EN and VI strings in this repo, but Vietnamese is
  provisional and should be flagged for native review when quality matters.
- Prefer writing locale keys before feature code so every announcement path is
  planned.
- Locale discovery and fallback must stay dynamic. Do not hardcode language
  branches in feature code; new languages should be added through locale files
  and metadata/registry layers. Missing translated strings or documentation
  must fall back to English rather than exposing raw keys to players.
- A live language change updates client-owned chrome before later localized
  packets, rebuilds that player's locale-bound action sets, and restores the
  semantic parent menu/focus. Browser clients must serialize their asynchronous
  locale-bundle load with later WebSocket packets so no stale language flashes.
- Validate server Fluent changes with `server/tools/compare_locales.py`; it
  reports missing keys, obsolete keys, variables, select/plural arms, and
  attributes. Do not leave obsolete target keys behind after refactors.

### String Localization & Contextual Broadcasting Standard

Whenever a new game is added or an existing game is modified with player-facing
string changes, perform a complete string and broadcast-context audit.

- Every actor-attributable gameplay broadcast must have distinct personal
  first-person and public third-person forms: the actor hears "You ...", while
  other listeners hear "<PlayerName> ...". Use `broadcast_personal_l(...)` or
  an equivalent per-listener localized helper. Do not send the actor the same
  third-person message as everyone else. Genuinely global events with no actor
  may use one shared form.
- Evaluate every message against the complete state and audience matrix,
  including actor versus observer, player versus team, success versus failure,
  active versus waiting/resolving state, option variants, spectators, bots,
  reconnect/save restoration, and relevant brief-announcement variants.
- Errors, warnings, disabled-action reasons, confirmations, and gameplay
  notifications must identify the attempted action, the specific blocking or
  resulting condition, and the state values needed to understand what happened
  and what the player can do next. Avoid generic messages such as "You cannot
  do that" when a contextual explanation is available.
- Keep EN/VI keys and variables structurally synchronized, localize
  listener-dependent values per recipient, and add tests for both actor and
  observer wording plus important contextual and error branches.

## Documentation

When writing or updating documentation, first read existing polished project
manuals for similar games and follow their standard structure, formatting, and
player-facing tone.

- Manuals must be beginner-friendly, accessible, and focused on how to play:
  overview, goal, turn flow, special mechanics, scoring, options, information
  actions, and shortcuts where relevant.
- Do not write manuals like changelogs, patch notes, design notes, or developer
  justifications. Leave out unnecessary implementation details and rationale
  that do not help a player understand the game.
- Keep vocabulary plain and concrete. Explain game terms before relying on
  them, especially for custom games or mechanics that may be unfamiliar.
- Keep EN/VI documentation synchronized in structure, meaning, terminology, and
  attribution. Vietnamese docs should be natural and friendly, with terminology
  aligned to the matching `.ftl` strings.
- Community translation work must follow `TRANSLATING.md`, including variable
  preservation, perspective-key parity, documentation fallback, and contributor
  credit metadata.

## Scores, Leaderboards, and Teams

- Only games with real leaderboard support should expose
  `get_supported_leaderboards()` entries.
- Every result for a wins or rating leaderboard must declare `winner_ids` by
  immutable player/account id. An empty list means a draw and must not create
  wins or losses. Never infer a competitive result from a name.
- A real team or a game that supplies more than winner/loser placement must
  store canonical `RATING_COMPETITORS_KEY` data built with
  `rating_competitors_from_scores(...)`. Each participant appears exactly once;
  equal ranks are ties, while ids grouped in one competitor are teammates.
- Rating calculation is side-effect free. Persist the completed result,
  aggregate stats, and validated rating updates in one database transaction.
  Raw model parameters are internal; player-facing views use the conservative
  skill score so a future tier policy can be layered on without changing the
  rating model or durable identities.
- Build every `PlayerResult` through `PlayerResult.from_player(...)`. A
  disconnected replacement bot remains owned by the reserved account, so its
  final result, stats, win/loss, and rating count for that account and a
  disconnect cannot dodge a loss. A completed seat substitution transfers
  ownership to the incoming account. A reversible host kick removes current
  table membership but retains the account-owned replacement seat so the same
  UUID can reclaim its complete context and result attribution; private-table
  admission must recognize that reservation. A kick-and-ban, account deletion,
  or other permanent removal rekeys the retained active seat to a fresh
  dedicated-bot UUID immediately, so no later result is attributed to the
  departed account; dedicated bots never receive durable player stats or
  ratings. Keep an unclaimed reversible reservation visible as a human-owned
  roster row so it cannot be mistaken for or removed as an ordinary bot.
- Startup garbage collection derives valid game types and persisted stat keys
  from the live registry. It removes unregistered-game data, unsupported
  derived leaderboard aggregates, and invalid rating rows; do not maintain a
  second hardcoded cleanup schema.
- Scoreless games should not claim score support; score buttons are hidden and
  `s` / `shift+s` are ignored silently.
- Games using default score actions must keep `TeamManager` synchronized.
- Non-point units need a localized `score_unit_key` in shared `games.ftl` or the
  game locale when unique. Units are display only; stored stats remain numeric.
- Brief score checks speak one line per player/team in the `game` buffer.
- Detailed score checks normally use `live_status_box(...)` with one line per
  player/team.
- Team games use shared team arrangement. Call
  `_setup_team_manager_for_start(...)`; use `_get_team_turn_players(...)` when
  seating affects turn order. Do not build per-game team selection UI.

## Persistence and Data Lifecycle

Any persistent feature must define and test:

- what is stored and why
- lifespan/retention
- cleanup/pruning of stale data
- account-deletion behavior
- migration/backward compatibility when schemas or supported games change

`Game.on_discard()` is the idempotent lifecycle hook for match-scoped caches,
bot observations, and similar memory that must not outlive its game instance.
The framework calls it whenever an instance is abandoned, including table
destruction, restart, game switching, and failed replacement preparation.
Games that launch asynchronous work must cancel it cooperatively here and drop
every job reference; background work must operate on an isolated snapshot and
must never call back into a discarded game. This hook does not replace the
retention and cleanup rules required for genuinely persistent data.

Do not add database rows, tables, saved runtime state, notifications, chat logs,
tokens, invites, moderation records, or similar data without this lifecycle.

## Chat Anti-Spam and Reports

- Apply chat throttles by immutable account ID and channel scope. Global chat is
  deliberately stricter than table chat; direct messages are isolated from
  both. Reconnects and switching channels must not bypass capacity.
- Automated detection may reject the spam-shaped message, but it must not mute,
  ban, lower reputation, or otherwise punish an account. Escalation creates a
  review-only System report after multiple time-separated incidents.
- Coalesce rapid retries into one incident. Automatic reports use a persistent
  per-account/per-scope cooldown so restarts cannot flood staff, and only a
  newly created report sends the localized staff alert and `system`-buffer
  notification sound.
- Automatic reports store versioned structured evidence and one bounded sample.
  They use the existing report lifecycle: retained until manual review and
  explicit cleanup, retained across target-account deletion, and included in
  database backups. Runtime limiter state is discarded on account deletion.

## Server Power Management

Server reboot and shutdown flows must go through the centralized server power
manager and admin UI. Do not add chat-command reboot/shutdown paths or
per-game shutdown hooks.

- Planned reboot preserves active tables through transient table checkpoints,
  freezes framework-owned mutation during finalization, skips normal bot
  substitution on disconnect, and lets clients auto-reconnect.
- Planned shutdown clears active table checkpoints and must warn players to
  save anything they want to keep before the server goes offline.
- Transient checkpoints need kind, creation time, expiration, pruning, and
  account-deletion cleanup. Keep the one-day checkpoint TTL unless a future
  migration explicitly changes the lifecycle.
- Post-reboot no-show handling belongs in shared table/game framework logic:
  restored tables receive a grace window, then missing active players are
  replaced with bots only when at least one human has returned; tables with no
  humans eventually close through abandoned-table cleanup.

## Database Maintenance

Live backup, cleanup, and compaction use the centralized reversible maintenance
manager, never ad-hoc database calls from an admin handler.

- Database startup is fail-closed. Never move, quarantine, replace, or rebuild
  an existing database automatically after an integrity, identity, version, or
  schema failure. Preserve the main file and sidecars for operator recovery.
- Schema changes require an incremented SQLite `user_version`, the PlayAural
  `application_id`, a full preflight integrity check, and a validated durable
  pre-migration backup before any existing schema is changed. Reject databases
  created by newer server versions. Opening SQLite must never run retention or
  compatibility cleanup; destructive cleanup is an explicit operation.
- Schema version 2 rebuilds legacy `users.username_key` storage so the canonical
  non-null identity contract is enforced; version-zero and version-one upgrades
  must remain atomic, backed up, and row-preserving.
- Schema version 3 compatibility-folds username lookup keys and makes the
  immutable account UUID index unique. Version-two upgrades must remain
  backed up and fail closed if invalid or duplicate account ids are found; never
  guess which account owns corrupted relational data.
- Migration preflight must reserve the backup and transaction workspace
  together when they share a filesystem. A retry may reuse only a fully
  validated pre-migration backup whose schema, row counts, and logical-content
  digest exactly match the unchanged source; never create duplicate snapshots
  merely because a prior migration transaction rolled back.
- Keep persistence SQL compatible with SQLite 3.25.0 and the SQLite 3.26.0
  runtime shipped by AlmaLinux 8. Do not use newer catalog aliases or
  maintenance syntax without deliberately raising and testing the baseline.
- Current-schema validation must fail closed on missing or unexpected tables,
  columns, triggers, and views, as well as malformed column definitions,
  primary/unique/check constraints, required index definitions, or foreign-key
  drift. Derive duplicated structural expectations from the canonical DDL when
  practical so schema creation and validation cannot silently diverge.
- Connections use explicit autocommit plus `_transaction()` for every
  multi-statement mutation. Never silently swallow unexpected SQLite failures;
  ordinary status/read paths must not perform retention cleanup as a side
  effect.
- Treat `SQLITE_IOERR_WRITE` as an operating-system storage fault, not a
  retryable SQLite conflict. Preserve every database artifact and report the
  paths, required space, and SQLite extended code so operators can inspect
  filesystem/mount health, kernel logs, quota and file-size limits, ownership,
  and SELinux before retrying. Deployments may place validated backups on a
  separate healthy filesystem with `--database-backup-dir`.
- Maintenance capacity preflights must test space allocatable by the running
  service identity, not only filesystem-wide free bytes, so user, group, and
  project quotas fail before SQLite touches authoritative data.
- Production deployment tooling must stop the game service before changing its
  environment, restore service-user ownership on database artifacts, and pass
  non-database fsync probes for both the live and backup directories before
  starting. Bound automatic restart loops so a persistent startup failure
  cannot repeatedly run migration or backup preparation unattended.
- Transient table checkpoints remain durable until database validation, schema
  migration, table deserialization, network binding, and tick startup have all
  succeeded. A failed startup must close SQLite and leave checkpoints intact.

- Stop authoritative ticks, reject new gameplay/account packets while leaving
  current menus visible, drain tracked in-flight work, and close the event-loop
  SQLite connection before starting maintenance on a worker-owned connection.
- Broadcast localized start and terminal notices with a `system`-buffer notify
  sound. Reject login, registration, and password-reset work before it reaches
  SQLite; authenticated attempts receive the active maintenance reason.
- Read-only storage analysis does not freeze gameplay, but it still owns the
  shared maintenance lock and storage-idle barrier. Shutdown and scheduled
  power operations must wait for its worker-owned SQLite connection to close.
- Once a blocking maintenance worker starts, coroutine cancellation cannot stop
  it. Wait for the worker, report its actual success or failure, and preserve a
  post-publication failure as storage-uncertain rather than replacing it with a
  cancellation result.
- Resume only after the live connection reopens and passes identity, schema,
  structural, and foreign-key validation. Reopen failure is
  fail-closed: keep gameplay frozen and require operator recovery.
- Backups use SQLite's online-backup API, a unique partial file, exact
  source/destination snapshot metadata checks, full integrity validation, file
  and directory flushes, and atomic publication in `server/backups/` by
  default. Never publish partial backups.
- Compaction creates a verified safety backup first, preflights space for both
  a staging copy and SQLite's temporary VACUUM database, VACUUMs a
  same-directory unpublished candidate in legacy DELETE-journal mode, and
  atomically replaces the live file only after full integrity, schema, and
  logical-content validation. Never run VACUUM against the authoritative file.
  Any failure after atomic replacement is fail-closed and requires operator
  recovery from the retained safety backup.
- Backups contain persistent SQLite state only, not runtime-only active-table
  state. They are retained until an operator removes them, are excluded from
  source control, and are not rewritten when an account is later deleted.
  Protect and rotate them operationally and keep an off-host copy.
- Storage cleanup is explicit, previewable, allowlisted maintenance. It creates
  a verified pre-cleanup backup, reevaluates candidates inside one atomic
  transaction, validates the result, and reports reusable pages without running
  compaction. Saved tables, game results, chat history, moderation reports,
  valid user blocks, compatibility data, valid backups, and logs are never
  cleanup candidates. Saved tables persist until their owner or a Developer
  explicitly deletes them.
- Filesystem cleanup is limited to narrowly named regular unpublished
  PlayAural backup fragments in the configured backup directory and
  database-specific compaction candidates in the database directory, all older
  than the shared abandonment threshold. Never recursively scan or delete
  arbitrary server files, authoritative SQLite sidecars, active logs, caches,
  valid backups, or recovery artifacts from the live administration workflow.

## Server, Web, Desktop, and Mobile Rules

- Server navigation uses `_nav_push`, `_nav_back`, `_nav_refresh`, and
  `_restore_frame`; action handlers should not call `_show_*()` directly.
  The stack remembers the opener item and restores focus on Back/cancel and
  action completion.
  Server-owned menu selections are validated against the active menu before
  dispatch; stale client packets and forged item ids are ignored.
- Use `_enter_input_state(...)` / `server.enter_input_state(...)` for editbox
  input state instead of mutating `_user_states`.
- Reconnect restoration and ghost cleanup must route through centralized restore
  code.
- Account handover is serialized per canonical username. Only the exact
  connection owned by the current `NetworkUser` may dispatch packets or run
  disconnect cleanup; stale sockets and callbacks must be harmless.
- Intentional application exit uses the generic authenticated `logout` packet.
  The server runs its ordered session-activity teardown handlers (including
  table and voice departure) before retiring the session and sending
  `force_exit`; clients must not duplicate game- or room-specific cleanup.
  Forced process loss remains an ordinary disconnect because browsers and
  mobile operating systems cannot guarantee a final network callback.
- Credential verification, password-reset eviction, moderation eviction, and
  account deletion must use that same account lock so a checked credential
  cannot install a session after its account or password changed.
- First-party releases update the server and all clients in lockstep. Only an
  exact server/client version match may install an authenticated session.
  Outdated native clients may receive the credential-verified update bootstrap
  needed by their mandatory updater, but must never own a `NetworkUser`,
  displace a current session, broadcast presence, or dispatch gameplay. Reject
  outdated Web clients before authentication. Do not add old packet-field
  aliases; retained account/config/table/save migrations remain required
  because persistent data survives releases.
- Never transfer rendered menus or editboxes between sessions. Rebuild UI from
  authoritative server/game intent using the replacement client's capabilities;
  device-only frames fall back to a valid shared parent.
- A live device handover does not pause authoritative timers/sequences, trigger
  bot substitution, add reconnect grace, or reset rate limits. Replay active
  audio layers to the new session, retire old output queues, and keep transient
  resume state bounded with explicit cleanup.
- Web client must never use `innerHTML` with server-controlled content.
- Web client code is modular: `game.js` is only the version/bootstrap entry;
  runtime logic belongs in `app.js`, `store.js`, `network.js`, `audio.js`,
  `a11y.js`, `keybinds.js`, `ui/`, and `locales/`.
- Web menus must preserve desktop-style keyboard behavior, touch activation,
  focus anchoring, bottom-ordered ARIA live regions, and capped/coalesced
  history rendering. Server editbox packets choose single-line versus
  multiline inputs through the `multiline` flag.
- Desktop and Web visual history must follow newly rendered messages to the
  bottom without stealing the reader's caret or focus. Compact Web history
  remains collapsible, focus-safe, and opens at the newest rendered message.
  Web history and chat drafts clear when an authenticated session ends, but
  survive automatic reconnection for that same session.
- Web speech prefs are `speech_mode`, `speech_voice`, `speech_rate`.
- Web game audio uses a `playback` audio session and switches to
  `play-and-record` only while the user explicitly publishes a voice-chat
  microphone. Recover previously running contexts after foregrounding without
  consuming the initial user gesture, and retain the lazy Ogg Vorbis fallback
  for browsers without native container support.
- Mobile speech prefs are `mobile_tts_engine`, `mobile_tts_voice`,
  `mobile_tts_rate`; unavailable synced voices/engines must fall back safely.
- Mobile native speech must serialize stop/start, await engine readiness, and
  recover failed bindings with bounded, configurable retries. Invalidate stale
  callbacks and voice discovery on engine replacement; do not estimate speech
  completion from text length. Keep the guarded `expo-speech` lifecycle patch
  and Android source-build requirement. Screen-reader events and foreground
  queries must not overwrite newer state or change the saved self-voicing
  preference. UI speech and game announcements retain separate ownership.
- Web locale catalogs are loaded through `web_client/locales/manifest.js` and
  `index.js`; mobile locale catalogs are loaded through the generated
  `mobile_client/src/i18n/localeCatalogs.ts` registry. Keep registry metadata
  synchronized when adding languages.
- Server locale directories must include `metadata.json` for translator credit
  and official/community status. Keep `languages.ftl` for localized language
  names; do not replace viewer-localized names with metadata-only labels.
- Mobile connects as `client: "mobile"`, is treated as touch, uses SecureStore
  for credentials, AsyncStorage for local prefs, and must enforce mandatory APK
  updates on version/sound-pack mismatch.
- Mobile Back resolves the visible dialog/input before local tabs or server
  menus. Preserve server escape behavior on same-menu updates. Boards must
  scroll on both axes without shrinking touch targets below the UI minimum;
  self-voicing focus must reveal the selected cell without delaying cursor or
  speech updates. Android boards use one native two-axis gesture owner and
  accessibility scroll surface; verify TalkBack two-finger panning and native
  directional scroll actions. Mobile message buffers are
  bounded runtime-only state, retain focus by message identity, and clear with
  chat drafts when returning to login; never persist them with account settings.
- Desktop passwords live only in OS keyring. Saved microphone devices must fall
  back to system default if unavailable.

## New Game Requirements

Files normally required:

- `server/games/<type>/__init__.py`
- `server/games/<type>/game.py`
- optional `server/games/<type>/bot.py`
- `server/locales/en/<type>.ftl`
- `server/locales/vi/<type>.ftl`
- `server/documentation/content/en/games/<type>.md`
- `server/documentation/content/vi/games/<type>.md`
- `server/tests/test_<type>.py`

Also register the game in `server/games/__init__.py`.

Documentation must follow the Documentation rules above and established game
docs: escaped markdown bold, overview, gameplay, special mechanics, scoring,
customizable options with defaults/ranges, and game-specific keyboard shortcuts.

Tests should cover registration/default options, pre-start validation, core
mechanics, scoring/scoreless behavior, bot completion, touch visibility/order,
keybind collisions, sound/TTS paths, transitions, and game completion.

## Code Style

- Module-level imports only, except `main()` in `client/client.py` where CWD
  setup must happen first.
- Prefer existing helpers and local patterns over new abstractions.
- Keep edits scoped; do not refactor unrelated code.
- Game classes: `<Name>Game`; player classes: `<Name>Player`; options:
  `<Name>Options`; type ids lowercase without separators; action ids
  `snake_case`.
- Handler names: `_action_<id>`; visibility: `_is_<id>_hidden`; enabled:
  `_is_<id>_enabled`.
- Use structured parsers/APIs where available; avoid ad-hoc string parsing.
- Update `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` when catalog counts or user-facing catalog
  data changes.
