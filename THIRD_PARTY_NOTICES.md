# Third-party software notices

PlayAural-authored source code is distributed under the GNU General Public
License, version 3 or any later version. See [LICENSE](LICENSE). That grant does not cover or
relicense third-party software, audio, or other assets. Each third-party work
remains under its own license or permission.

This file identifies the direct libraries used by the first-party components
and the complete notices for source or binary artifacts that are checked into
this repository. The lockfiles are the authoritative inventory of exact and
transitive package versions:

- Python desktop: [client/uv.lock](client/uv.lock)
- Python server: [server/uv.lock](server/uv.lock)
- Rust/Cosmos: [cosmos/Cargo.lock](cosmos/Cargo.lock)
- Web: [web_client/package-lock.json](web_client/package-lock.json)
- Mobile: [mobile_client/package-lock.json](mobile_client/package-lock.json)

Release builders must retain the license and notice files supplied by resolved
transitive packages. When a dependency or lockfile changes, its licensing must
be reviewed before publishing the resulting source or binary distribution.
Every resolved Web and mobile npm package currently declares its license in the
corresponding lockfile; repository tests fail if that metadata is omitted.

## Compatibility and distribution guidance

This file is an inventory, not a legal opinion or a declaration that every
possible binary combination is license-compatible. In particular, the Apache
Software Foundation and the Free Software Foundation state that Apache-2.0 is
compatible with GPLv3 but not GPLv2 for a combined derivative work. PlayAural
is GPL-3.0-or-later and uses Apache-2.0 components, including Steam Audio and
LiveKit. The project license therefore permits a GPLv3-compatible combination,
provided distributors comply with the applicable GPLv3 and Apache-2.0 terms
and preserve every required third-party notice. Distributors remain responsible
for reviewing the licenses and packaging of the binaries they publish.

## Audio and other assets

The GPL-3.0-or-later grant for PlayAural-authored software does not automatically
cover sound files, music, artwork, game data, or other third-party assets in
the repository. No repository-wide, per-asset provenance and permission
inventory currently exists for the checked-in sound packs. A file's presence
in the repository must not be interpreted as a license grant beyond permission
recorded by its copyright holder. Maintainers must verify and document the
origin and redistribution rights of every asset before a public source or
binary release that includes it.

Bingo includes a per-asset record:
[`server/games/bingo/AUDIO_PROVENANCE.md`](server/games/bingo/AUDIO_PROVENANCE.md)
lists the source, author, applicable terms, and recorded edits for each of its
eight sound files.

licensed for endorsement or affiliation; the checked-in trademark terms govern
their descriptive use. Steam Audio's own third-party notice file covers the
libraries incorporated into its official binaries.
